  <p class="drop-cap">THE object of the present work is to bring before the notice of the
    general reader and tourist the advantages and pleasure accruing from
    a few weeks’ sojourn among the mountains and fjords of that grand yet
    simple country, Norway. Everywhere abounding with features of interest,
    it will especially commend itself to the Englishman when he calls to
    mind how close was the link between the Scandinavians and his ancestors.</p>

  <p>To travel profitably it is not sufficient merely to notice or admire
    scenic effects. Men and manners should also be closely observed; and
    no object or detail, however trivial, should be neglected or deemed
    beneath regard. Norway presents a wide field for observation and
    research, whatever may be the tastes and predilections of the visitor.
    Here may the geologist, if so disposed, find ample material for study;
    the archæologist and antiquarian may revel among Runic stones, Viking
    tumuli, rites and ceremonies, quaint wood-carvings adorned with the
    ever-twining serpent, costumes, customs, &amp;c.; the keenest sportsman
    will find a treat in store for him; while the lover of the grand in
    nature and of simple rustic life will meet with them here to his
    heart’s content. But to do this the main roads and cities must be
    abandoned for the mountains and fjelds, with their reindeer tracts and
    trout streams.</p>

  <p>To the Fjeld, then, to the Fjeld! with its beautiful flora and mosses,
    its sport, its avalanches and landslips, its balmy air and soothing
    zephyrs. To the Fjeld&mdash;off to the Fjeld!</p>

      <i>Tyssestrængene Fos.</i></span>OR
    comparatively few years has Norway received any attention from
    the travelling public. The beauty and grandeur of the country and the
    simple habits of the people were known to but few, and only heard of
    occasionally from some energetic salmon fisher who preferred outdoor
    life, good sport, plain food, and vigorous health to the constant
    whirl of advanced civilisation, busy cities, over-crowded <i lang="fr">soirées</i>,
    high-pressure dinners, and the general hurry-skurry of modern life.
    The words “Gamle Norge,” or old Norway, while exciting the greatest
    enthusiasm in Norway itself, rejoice the heart not only of many an
    Englishman who has become practically acquainted with its charms,
    but of those who, having heard of them, long to go and judge for
    themselves. Nor is the expression of modern introduction; it was
    evidently well known in the sixteenth century, as our immortal bard
    alludes to it in <cite>Hamlet</cite>.</p>

  <p>Forty-five years ago Norway and its salmon fisheries were unknown
    luxuries. Even as late as 1839 Murray published a post-octavo Handbook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
    for Travellers in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, in the preface to which
    occur the subjoined passages:&mdash;</p>

  <p>“The principal object of the following pages is to afford such of my
    travelling countrymen as are disposed to quit the more beaten paths
    of Southern Europe, and explore the less known, but equally romantic,
    regions of the north, some useful information as to time and distance,
    which at present they can only obtain by time and experience. Beyond
    Hamburg all is unknown land; no guide-book contains any account of the
    Baltic steamboats, still less of the means of travelling, either by
    land or water, in the more distant lands of Norway and Sweden. At the
    steam-packet offices in London you may learn that an English steamer
    sails three times a month from Lubec to Stockholm, but no further
    information can be obtained.</p>

  <div class="clear center">
    •<span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span>
  </div>

  <p>“Unless the weather is unusually stormy, and the passage of the
    vessel has consequently been delayed, the steamer remains in the
    outer harbour, called Klippen, for four or five hours; enabling the
    passengers who are going straight to Norway to inspect the city,
    which is well worth seeing. A miniature steamboat, the smallest I
    have ever seen, conveys you from the quay, at which the larger vessel
    remains moored, up the long harbour to the town itself, the journey
    occupying about half-an-hour. In the afternoon the <cite>Constitution</cite>
    continues her voyage, stretching much further out to sea, in crossing
    the Skager Rack, until, at an early hour the next morning, you reach
    Frederiksværn, the principal arsenal of Norway, situated at the
    entrance of the winding fjord of Christiania. From this place a smaller
    coasting steamboat conveys the passengers to Christiania, touching, in
    its passage up the Christiania fjord, at the various small towns and
    villages on either shore.</p>

  <div class="clear center">
    •<span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span>
  </div>

  <p>“Steam vessels have for the last two or three years plied between
    Christiania and Frederiksværn and Bergen, but their times of leaving
    have hitherto been very irregular; beyond Bergen I am not aware that
    any regular communication has hitherto been projected.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

  <p>“No traveller has any business to intrude among the mountain fastnesses
    of Norway, unless he can not only endure a fair proportion of bodily
    fatigue, but can likewise put up with accommodations of the coarsest
    description. As far as Christiania this, of course, does not apply: the
    transport thither is by a comfortable steamboat, and the Hôtel du Nord
    sufficiently good to satisfy any man; but when you attempt to penetrate
    into the bowels of the land the case is different.</p>

  <p>“The Norsemen are strict Lutherans; scarcely an individual is to be
    met with professing any other creed, and no place of worship of any
    other kind exists in Norway. No Jew is allowed to set foot in Norway&mdash;a
    strange law in this free country. It has often struck me as a curious
    anomaly, that in the free cities of the Continent these unhappy
    outcasts were far worse treated than under many despotic governments.
    Commercial jealousy in a great measure accounts for this enmity in a
    city of merchants, but in a poor and thinly-populated country like
    Norway this motive could have no weight. I have been unable to learn
    from what cause the exclusion originated, though it is said to have
    originated from some idle fear that they would possess themselves of
    the produce of the silver mines at Kongsberg; but it is certainly a
    most startling fact that the freest people on earth should cling with
    such watchful jealousy to one of the most illiberal and inhuman laws
    that can be conceived.”</p>

  <p>Soon after this our real sport-lovers began to discover the charms of
    Norway, Sir Hyde Parker, Sir Richard Sutton, and Lionel James leading
    the van; and within the space of forty years the transition has taken
    place from free fishing and shooting to the Scotch system of letting
    moors&mdash;a state of things that would astonish Forrester and Biddulph,
    whose work on Norway has now become historical and of the greatest
    interest. Forrester begins thus (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1834):&mdash;“Eight days in
    the North Sea, beating against foul winds, or, which was still worse,
    becalmed amongst fleets of Dutch fishing-boats, and ending in a regular
    gale of wind, which was worst of all, prepared us to hail the sight
    of land, and that of the coast of Norway.” This passage was made in a
    little Norwegian schooner, bound from Gravesend to the south of Norway.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

  <p>How different is it now! Thanks to Messrs. Wilson, steamers take us
    thither almost to the hour, unless, indeed, the clerk of the weather
    should connive with old Neptune to teach us a lesson, by reminding us
    that the elements are not yet to be ordered about entirely as we like.
    English visitors commenced about 1824; Lord Lothian, Lord Clanwilliam,
    and Lord H. Kerr, 1827; Marquis of Hastings, 1829; and in 1830 we
    have Elliott’s account of Norway. Those were early days, when the
    <i lang="nn">bönder</i> were astonished, and could hardly believe their own eyes, when
    Englishmen went down with a piece of thread and a kind of coach-whip
    to kill a salmon of thirty pounds; or, again, when the first flying
    shot opened a new world to them. Those were the times when members of
    the Storthing (or Parliament) appeared in the costume of their own
    district, with belts, tolle-knives, &amp;c. They were not so eager to grasp
    at civilisation as the Japanese, who simultaneously took to elastic
    boots, tall black hats, and the English language within a year. No;
    they are a contented people, with no desire for change, or to have it
    thrust upon them, until they discover that they can make money of the
    delighted foreigner, who, elevated by the grandeur of the mountain
    scenery, grows more warm-hearted, kind, and generous than ever. Then
    the Norseman becomes rabid and exacting; but the provinces (thank
    Heaven!) still preserve their primitive simplicity.</p>

  <p>Let us, then, hasten to these happy hunting-grounds. The fjeld life
    will blow all the smoke out of us, and if we love nature we can store
    up health and purity of thought, and bring back concentrated food for
    happy reflection, should we be spared to a good old age. How such
    reminiscences will then come out, brightened by the fact that all the
    petty <i lang="fr">désagréments</i> of travel have been forgotten as they receded
    in the past! We need not enlarge on the pleasures of anticipation,
    the punctual meeting at the railway station, the satisfaction of
    knowing that nothing has been omitted or left behind&mdash;a congratulation
    sometimes a little blighted by the discovery that some one, after
    ransacking everything, cannot find his breech-loader or cartridge
    cases, or that some one else has left his pet “butchers” or “blue
    doctors” on his dressing-table. Should such mischances occur, they
    are soon dissipated in the general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span> atmosphere of enjoyment and
    anticipation, assisted by the thought that it is of no use losing
    one’s temper, as it is sure to be found again, and the temporary loss
    of it grieves one’s friends unnecessarily, to say nothing of personal
    discomfort. Happy thought&mdash;always leave your ill-temper at home; or,
    better still, do not have one: it is not a home comfort.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>Christiansand.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>The first port touched <i lang="fr">en route</i> for the capital of Norway is
    Christiansand, which is snugly hidden in the extreme south of the
    district of Sætersdalen&mdash;that land of eccentricity in costume and
    quaintness of habitation, of short waists and long trousers reaching to
    the shoulders, above which come the shallow, baby-looking jackets. With
    what zest does one strain for the first peep at a seaport of a foreign
    land! What value is attached to the earliest indication of varying
    costume, or even a new form of chimney! The steamer from Hull generally
    arrives at Christiansand on Sunday, when it is looking its neatest, the
    white tower of the church shining over the wooden houses of the town,
    the Norwegian shipping all in repose, with the exception, perhaps, of
    the heavy, compressed, Noah’s ark kind of dumpy barges, or a customs’
    gig containing some official. As we looked up at the church tower we
    could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span> not but wonder if we should hear, during our short visit, the
    whistle of the “Vægter;” for tradition says that, for the protection
    of the place, a watchman is always on the look-out, ready to give the
    alarm should a fire break out in the town, which, being built almost
    entirely of wood, would soon be reduced to a heap of ashes. But no; we
    heard no whistle, not even a rehearsal. <i lang="nn">On dit</i> that for three hundred
    years has the Vægter looked out afar, and no alarum has issued from the
    tower. Christiansand has been mercifully preserved from fire, and long
    may it be so!</p>

  <p>During the passage over a friend told me of a Norwegian he once met
    on board. He was a Christiansander. The Norseman was in high glee,
    and, having entered into conversation with my friend, soon proposed a
    <i lang="nn">skaal</i> (health). This achieved, the story of the Norseman began to
    run rapidly off the reel, and it is so characteristic of the people
    that we cannot do better than repeat it here. Born at Christiansand,
    at the age of sixteen Lars became restless, wanted to see America, and
    make his way in life, for which there was not much scope in the small
    seaport. Lars’s father and mother were then living, with one daughter,
    who would take care of them whilst he started for the battle-field
    of life. He therefore determined to go. On his arrival in America he
    had a terrible struggle for existence, there being so many emigrants
    of all nations and classes. After patient endurance he began to get
    on, and saved sufficient to go to Chicago and California. During this
    time of trial how he thought about the chimes from the old white
    tower, the Vægter, and the fair-haired sister he had left behind, and
    wondered if all were well with the old people! At San Francisco he
    did pretty well for some time; but hearing one day that at Yokohama,
    in Japan, there was a good opening for a supply of butter (<i lang="nn">smör</i>),
    his Norske associations were aroused, and his thoughts ran back to
    <i lang="nn">sæters</i>, <i lang="nn">piger</i>, cows, cream, and green pastures. That was the thing
    for Lars. So off he started for Yokohama, and having established a
    lucrative butter business, he determined to write home and send some
    money to his father and mother. This was a great pleasure to the
    kind-hearted fellow, while their answer assured him of the joy of those
    whom he had left behind on hearing of his safety and success, and
    receiving such a token of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> filial love. But the associations of home
    and childhood are strong, and it was not long before he experienced
    a desire to return. At length, however, he decided on developing the
    butter trade still further, and then, having a good offer to go back
    to San Francisco, he sold the whole business and good-will for a good
    round sum, and started on a new career, which this time took the form
    of brewing. How Norwegian! what national items!&mdash;butter (<i lang="nn">smör</i>) and
    ale (<i lang="nn">öl</i>). Again Lars was successful, and derived much comfort from
    the fact that he was thereby enabled to enhance the home happiness at
    Christiansand. Happy the son who comforts a father! Happy the paternal
    old age cherished by a son’s love! Beer, or rather ale, became the
    basis of a lucrative business. Lars, however, speedily discovered that
    bottled ale was the leading article to make the concern pay largely.
    But bottles were the difficulty; they were expensive items, and not
    manufactured in San Francisco. Lars often thought over this problem,
    which his partner, likewise, was unable to solve. Luckily one evening
    the good Norseman&mdash;he must have been indulging in a quiet pipe&mdash;had
    a happy thought. While musing over his early days the bottle-makers
    of Christiansand passed before him. He at once decided on making
    arrangements for visiting the old seaport, and, having seen those
    most dear to him on earth, to bring a bottle manufacturer back with
    him, thus combining business with pleasure. This is the yarn he told
    my friend, and when they entered the harbour poor Lars’s anxiety was
    intense. He had telegraphed to say that he was coming, and expected
    some one to meet and welcome him. During his absence he had heard
    that his sister had married happily, and that the son-in-law was very
    kind to his father; so Lars’s mind was set at rest. A boat neared the
    steamer, in the stern-sheets of which sat an aged man, a fair-haired
    Norseman rowing him. The old man was Lars’s father, who was soon on
    deck looking round, but he could not see his boy. At last, however, he
    spied him, and, throwing his arms round his neck, was fairly overcome
    with joy. On recovering, the old gentleman began a good flow of Norske,
    when poor Lars for the first time realised how long he had been away;
    for, like the Claimant, he could not remember his native language, and
    it was some time before either of them thought of landing. Meanwhile,
    we heartily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> wish the good Lars increased success. May his bottles be
    manufactured on the spot, and his good <i lang="nn">öl</i> cheer the heart without
    muddling the brain!</p>

  <p>When <em>we</em> entered Christiansand <em>we</em> also looked out for a boat; for Hans
    Luther Jordhoy had come down from Gudbransdalen to meet us, and was
    soon on board. A closely knit frame, fair beard, moderate stature,
    and kindly eye&mdash;there stood our future companion before us. Our first
    impressions were never disturbed; he had very good points, and has
    afforded us many pleasing associations in connection with our visit to
    Norge.</p>

  <p>As we steamed out of the harbour of Christiansand we met a passenger
    coast steamer coming in&mdash;one of those innumerable small screw steamers
    which run in and out of every fjord from Cape Lindesnæs to the North
    Cape. Are their names not written in <cite>Norges Communicationer</cite>, the
    Norwegian <cite>Bradshaw</cite>? The kindly feeling of the Norwegians towards the
    English was at once manifest, for no sooner did the brass band on board
    the excursion boat recognise our nationality than it struck up “God
    save the Queen.” We quite regretted that we had no band to return the
    compliment, and the only thing left for us was to give them a hearty
    cheer.</p>

  <p>This done, we started on our run to Christiania, with comparatively
    smooth water, a lovely evening, a prolonged <i lang="la">crepusculum</i>, and,
    late in the evening, a sweet little French song, sung with the most
    delightful simplicity by a lady. “Petites Fleurs des Bois” is indelibly
    impressed on the mind of the Patriarch. When it afterwards became known
    that we were indebted to an English bride for such a treat&mdash;which
    it really was&mdash;the bachelors whispered “A happy bond of union!” but
    considered, at the same time, that Norwegian travelling was scarcely
    made on purpose for honeymooning. Take carrioles, for instance, or the
    jolting <i lang="nn">stolkjærre</i>, in which the bride might sometimes find herself
    unceremoniously thrown into the lap of the bridegroom, or <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>.
    No; unless the lady is familiar with the manners, customs, and petty
    inconveniences attendant on travelling in Norway, that country will not
    prove the happy hunting-ground for honeymoons. </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

  <p>The whole of the Christiania fjord is both grand and immense. A
    decided flutter takes place on board when the town is in sight, and
    preparations are made for disembarkation. Hans Luther had by this
    time made a personal acquaintance with our luggage, and went to the
    Custom House, whither we were soon sent for. Among our possessions
    were discovered certain condiments and preserved provisions unknown to
    the officials, one item especially&mdash;pea soup in powder. On our arrival
    we suggested that the unusual product should be tasted. To this the
    official at first demurred, but ultimately yielded. Unfortunately,
    at the very moment of putting the powder to his lips, he drew a long
    breath, which sent the dry powdered pea soup down the wrong way.
    However, after a time he recovered, when doubtlessly he registered a
    mental vow never, never again to taste any foreign importation.</p>

  <p>We were soon at the Victoria Hotel, with its quaint courtyard, with
    galleries running round it, excessively tame pigeons hopping and
    perching on all sides, and a reindeer head nailed to the woodwork.
    During the tourist season a large marquee is erected in the centre of
    this courtyard for <i lang="fr">tables d’hôte</i> and extra meals. In the meantime we
    hurried to our rooms, longing to be out in a boat for a general view of
    the city. A few extras were, however, requisite before starting in real
    earnest, amongst which were two rifle slings. These had to be made,
    and are referred to here because they were the means of initiating us
    into one of the customs of the place. The leather slings were well
    made, but the price was most <i lang="nn">tolky</i> (exorbitant). This led to a mild
    remonstrance, upon which the saddler wrote us a remarkable letter,
    which it is a pity we cannot present <i lang="la">verbatim</i>. It was to the effect
    that the saddler was happy to serve us well, but thinking we were
    English gentlemen, he imagined we should prefer giving English prices.
    However, if we merely wished to pay in accordance with the Norwegian
    tariff, it would only be so much, which was precisely the amount we did
    pay.</p>

  <p>Christiania has a population of about seventy thousand, and owes
    its modern appearance to the destruction of the old town by fire.
    Nowadays the suburbs extend widely all round it, while to the westward
    villas reach almost to Oscar’s Hall, an object of interest distinctly
    visible both from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span> the town and the fortress, being only about four
    miles distant by land, and half that amount by water. The villa,
    with its high tower, is the property of the King, and is rich in the
    native talent of Tidemand, who was the national genre painter of his
    day. There are magnificent views of the fjord, bay, and surrounding
    mountains from all points, whether high or low, from the fortress or
    from the Egeberg, from the tower of the church in the market-place,
    or, farther off, from the Frogner Sæter and the Skougemsaas. For the
    latter, however, a long day should be taken.</p>

  <p>To visit Oscar’s Hall the most pleasant way is to take a boat and row
    across. This was suggested by Hans, and we were glad to find that
    he took kindly to boat work, as he came from Gudbransdalen, which
    is inland. More pleased, however, were we to discover, when about
    half-way across, that Hans was gradually bursting out into song,
    singing in a clear voice one of Kjerulf’s sweetest compositions,
    which we give in part at the end of the chapter. There is a plaintive
    sweetness throughout it, and the beauty of the evening, coupled with
    the surprise, caused us to anticipate <span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>many future repetitions, as
    nothing, when travelling, is more humanising and soothing than vocal or
    instrumental music.</p>

  <p>The University, the Storthing, museums, and Mr. Bennett have already
    been frequently described: still just one word. Every Englishman is
    received by Mr. Bennett, who carries out his slightest wish. We only
    called to see him, and get some <i lang="nn">smaapenge</i>; for if we had not, no one
    would have believed that we had been to Norway. Before the country
    was well opened Mr. Bennett must have been of the greatest service to
    visitors.</p>

  <p>During our very short stay we had an excellent opportunity of judging
    of the character of the people when collected in masses. There were
    to be a great procession of guilds and all kinds of things at the New
    Palace. These we attended, and very gratified we were to find how
    orderly the good folk were; how quiet, and yet with what a sense of
    comfortable enjoyment, if we may use the term; no excitement, but a
    cheerful interest in all that was going on; no crushing, no rush of
    roughs. If such were the case in large towns, we considered it augured
    well for the provinces.</p>

  <p>Between Christiania and Kongsberg much timber is seen wending its way
    down to the fjord. An instance of a <em>timber jam</em> after a shoot is
    given in the accompanying illustration. Sometimes trees are torn away
    at flood-time. The regular timber is duly marked and started, and at
    certain periods of the year persons follow the course of the river for
    the purpose of releasing the <em>jams</em> and helping the timber on its way
    to Drammen, where it is shipped for all parts of the world.</p>

  <p class="mb5">Little is said here of the cities of Christiania, Bergen, and
    Trondhjem, as our path lies in the open, the fjeld life, <i lang="nn">sæters</i>,
    peasants, and sport. Our delight is to live out of the present century
    in fresh air and simplicity, where trolds might cross our path, where
    we might see the lovely Huldre, the beauty who had the unfortunate
    appendage of a cow’s tail, which, when exposed to view, was the signal
    for her to vanish into thin air, or where Odin and Thor had had great
    <i lang="nn">jagt</i>, and killed bears, elks, gluttons, and wolves. The scenes we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
    longed for were those in which pagan rites had been carried out with
    all the grandeur of mighty warriors and priests worthy of Valhalla;
    wherein Vikings, after deeds of valour, were laid low, and buried with
    great solemnity and becoming pomp in their own war vessels, with their
    treasure, their arms, and their hunting-gear about them, waiting for
    the call to glory.</p>

    <span class="drop-img illow25" id="i_019"><img src="images/i_019.jpg" alt="T" /></span>HELEMARKEN
    is a large district, lying in the south-east of Norway,
    north of Sætersdalen, which is the most southern part of the kingdom.
    It is characterized by forest, costume, and wood-carving, the latter
    being applied on a large scale to the external decoration of houses,
    and especially to the storehouse, which is always a separate building
    of one story, and locally called the <i lang="nn">stabur</i>. On the exterior of
    this structure is lavished all the carving talent and energy of the
    proprietor and his friends; while inside will be found good old
    coffers, containing the silver and the tankards, the brooches and
    the bridal crown, which is handed down from generation to generation
    amongst the <i lang="nn">bönder</i>, or farmers. A public parochial crown is sometimes
    to be heard of, and may be seen at the lawyer’s, for that profession is
    known in Norway; and, when litigation commences, it is impossible to
    guess the time over which it may extend. But to return to wood-carving,
    so important a feature in the dwellings of the inhabitants of this
    part.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> A fine specimen of carved lintel, or side-post, is in existence
    near Lysthus, displaying wonderful solidity, and a flowing Runic design
    extremely difficult to copy. How was it originated? What was the
    <i lang="fr">motif</i> of the design? After making a careful study of it, it appears
    to be the result of “eyes”&mdash;generally associated without hooks&mdash;being
    kept to themselves, and interlaced, one following the other. On trying
    this, it was found to be practicable and most successful. Talking
    over this glorious old work with the good housewife, she called her
    husband, who went off to the <i lang="nn">stabur</i>, and, quickly returning, told me
    there was a very old and handsome pair of these lintels lying under
    the “provision house,” and begged me to accept them in recollection of
    my visit, and take them back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> to my own home, that they might give me
    pleasure there. Great was my wish to accept them, but the difficulty of
    transit soon flashed across my mind. Our route lay over the Haukelid,
    with hours of snow&mdash;ponies sinking in, and perhaps through. So the
    transit being impossible, I tendered my thanks for the kindly offer. It
    was with much regret that I did so, but what could be done hundreds of
    miles from home, and just starting over the roughest mountain tracts
    to the north-west of Norway? Nothing but a grateful negative, and a
    suggestion that they should be given to the next nice young couple who
    were starting housekeeping. The principal carving, as we have already
    observed, is lavished on the storehouses; and as soon as a loving
    couple are engaged, the man begins to build his nest, with nothing much
    but his axe for strong work and a knife for ornamentation. The latter
    instrument is most adroitly used by the peasants, cutting all sweeping
    curves, with the left-hand thumb used as a lever. The house-building
    is characterized by large timbers squared, afterwards calked with
    moss, and the ends crossing. As will be hereafter shown, the timbers
    are generally numbered externally up to twelve, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span> they may be
    easily rebuilt should occasion arise to remove the house elsewhere.
    Looking at these immense solid timbers, what a contrast they present to
    modern work; how like their sturdy forefathers, who worked so solidly;
    how unlike the feather-edged boarding of the new half-civilised houses
    which are now being introduced near towns, and are flimsiness itself,
    and only carpenter’s shoddy!</p>

  <p>Kongsberg is a city of rushing waters, or rather a small town; and
    approaching it is suggestive of proximity to a seltzer-water bottle
    with the cork partially out. The river rushes, splutters, fumes,
    foams, and steams; huge sticks, fir poles, and stems battling their
    way down the broken waters to Drammen, preparatory to their being
    shipped for the warmer and drier sphere of civilisation and circular
    saws. Some three English miles below Kongsberg is the Labro Fos, which
    is very interesting, and well worth visiting, inasmuch as it affords
    an admirable opportunity of seeing the timber shoot the Fos&mdash;large
    fir-stems sometimes coming clean over the fall into the roar below.</p>

    <img class="w100" src="images/i_022.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>Carved Houses, Bru, Thelemarken.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>Kongsberg is a centre of interest, as close by are found the silver
    mines which have for ages supplied the raw material for the <i lang="nn">gamle
    sölv</i>, such as silver crowns, belts, cups, tankards, and all the
    endless <span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>variety of ornament for which Gamle Norge has been, and is,
    so famous. However, we will not now enter into this subject, but will
    merely mention that interesting specimens of this class of work are to
    be found in England, souvenirs of travel which are highly prized by the
    happy possessors and their friends also. The silver is not considered
    very pure, but the old designs are very grand and admirable. The modern
    specimens, and especially those in filigree, are far inferior, being
    poor in design and unsubstantial.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Forests are most typical of Thelemarken, and very suggestive of bears
    in winter, a season much more severe here than in some other parts
    of Norway, as the district is away east, beyond the influence of
    the gulf-stream. It is a curious fact that directly an Englishman
    arrives in Thelemarken everybody seems to have seen bears, or, to be
    more precise, to have had visions of bears. That there are bears is
    certain. A sport-loving Oxonian last year was disappointed of a bear
    in the north, and, coming south on his return to shoot blackcock, had
    lighted his pipe and was walking quietly back when he saw a bear! He
    was seventy yards off, and had only one cartridge. He fired. Bruin,
    falling back on his haunches, put out his “embracers,” and rushed
    forward for the “hug,” when he gave a roll and fell backwards&mdash;dead.
    He was a splendid beast, judging from the skin. What a trophy to bring
    home! “What luck!” some said. On his return, the fortunate hunter&mdash;who,
    by-the bye, was a week later than he should have been&mdash;heard the
    momentous words from his dear parent, “Well, sir, where is the bear you
    went out to shoot in Norway?” “Have you not seen it? It’s in the hall.”
    “Oh, my dear boy, I am so delighted&mdash;so glad! Come, let us have the
    skin up here. Send for mamma. This is capital!” How much nicer it is
    to bring home a bear-skin than to have to say, “Didn’t shoot one!” Who
    does not know what zest there always is in success?</p>

  <p>The costume of the district is worn in every-day life, by the farmers
    as well as the peasants; in fact, the farmers, or <i lang="nn">bönder</i>, are very
    proud of their dress. First and foremost is the typical white jacket,
    with light blue facings and silver buttons; blue collars, blue pocket
    flaps, with silver buttons also; the jacket turned well back, with a
    light blue <i lang="fr">revers</i>, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> I think the ladies call it. But the great
    characteristic of the jacket is not to be too long; the <i lang="nn">ton</i> only have
    the back to come down just below the shoulder-blade; and, as the black
    trousers rush up to meet the curtailed garment, one can imagine the
    vast area of black trouser before arriving at the foot of the figure;
    it really makes them all look out of drawing.</p>

  <p>The women wear a chocolate-coloured handkerchief cleverly twisted round
    the head and falling down the back, with the hair plaited; and well
    they look with their fair hair and ribbons, their homespun or <i lang="nn">vadmel</i>
    petticoats closely kilt-plaited, old silver brooches and studs, and
    sometimes silk handkerchiefs as aprons, with coloured cinctures, the
    bodice with dark ground and flowers, crewel-worked, in relief. Near
    Lysthus the costume is nearly all blue, a kind of short frock-coat,
    with dark blue trouser-gaiters, embroidered up the side with yellow and
    scarlet; but this is not a successful phase of costume.</p>

  <p>On Sunday every variety is seen, and the additional interest of lake
    travelling is met with&mdash;namely, the raft boats, consisting of seven
    stems of trees, the longest in the middle, the six cut shorter, like
    organ pipes; midships a seat for one; while the oars are tied in with
    green birch twigs with the leaves on. How suggestive of early lake
    habitation, and yet how like a modern outrigger; for there is only room
    for one and a <i lang="nn">fine</i>, or provision box, from which a Norwegian, male or
    female, is inseparable.</p>

  <p>The shortness of the jackets is shown in an illustration which
    represents a custom peculiar to this part, namely, smoking the cows
    (see <a href="#Page_36">p. 36</a>). Many travellers have complained of the flies in Norway,
    and now even Norwegian cows object to them, and the farm folk, in
    kindly sympathy, make fires of juniper, the smoke of which is unwelcome
    to the mosquitoes. Into this smoke the cows are only too glad to go,
    and being well flavoured with juniper, are ready to start forth for the
    day, regardless of their little winged enemies. We speak from practical
    experience when we add that the traveller likewise will be rather
    benefited by participating in the process.</p>

  <p>Here, perhaps, it would be as well to refer to the hour-glass under
    the initial letter at the commencement of the chapter. It is composed
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> brass, and placed by the side of the pulpit, which is opposite
    to the King’s pew or box in the church at Kongsberg. There are four
    hour-glasses&mdash;quarter, half, three-quarters, and hour; so the domine,
    or minister, turns the glass before commencing his discourse, and the
    congregation knows how long he will continue. At Tönsberg there is a
    curious mural historical souvenir, consisting of the top of a stool let
    into the wall, on which may be read the following:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“In the year 1589, being the 11th day of November, came the well-born
      gentleman, Mr. Jacobus Stuart, King of Scotland: and the 25th Sunday
      after Trinity, which was the 16th day of November, he sat on this stool
      and heard a preaching from the 23rd Psalm, ‘The Lord is my Shepherd.’
      Mr. David Lentz preached, and he preached between 10 and 12.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <div class="figcenter illow100" id="i_025">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_025.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>The Raft Boat: Thelemarken.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>This “well-born gentleman” was evidently James the First of England and
    Sixth of Scotland, who married Anne of Denmark, sister of Christian IV.</p>

  <p>Leaving Lysthus, we settled down for steady travelling in that most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
    delightful style, namely, with our tents and luggage, sometimes in
    a <i lang="nn">stolkjær</i>, or country cart, sometimes with ponies only. Such
    independence, such health-giving enjoyment, can hardly be obtained
    under different circumstances. The travellers in this case were three,
    happily organized in the following manner. They might for the nonce
    be called Brown, Jones, and Robinson, as a tribute of respect to the
    originals in the “Primer or Spelling Book,” published in 1790, where
    those now world-known names are first found associated. Let us rather
    go with the times, and number them&mdash;a treatment now general in hotels,
    both at home and abroad.</p>

  <p>So, to commence, No. 1 was the youngest, and unanimously elected
    Paymaster-general. Polyglot in his knowledge of languages, he shone
    when asked to explain: then came such volleys of Norske, German,
    Danish, Swedish, French, Italian, all in one flowing Norskey catena,
    that, if people did not understand them, they felt they ought to,
    and acted accordingly. All this was carried out with the dash of a
    Zouave, and garnished with a profound knowledge of music and brilliant
    execution on the piano. How we longed sometimes for a pocket piano! No.
    1’s great <i lang="fr">forte</i> was enthusiasm for fishing&mdash;trout, salmon, greyling,
    and split-cane fly-rods. Tradition says that he has often in his
    sleep talked of “blue doctors,” “large butchers,” and “black doses,”
    these sounds having been heard in the small hours of the morning
    zephyring from his tent with nasal accompaniments; but he was always
    equal to the occasion, even when some one had landed with the luggage
    by mistake. “Never mind, my dear boy; sure to find it; most honest,
    charming people, these Norwegians&mdash;never lose anything.” Such were the
    comforting words which emanated from No. 1 when he understood that No.
    3 had lost his luggage; but when he found that it was his own a change
    came over the spirit of his dream. The polyglot vocabulary was soon
    launched, the fire of the Zouave flared up, a carriole was ordered,
    and the pursuit commenced, which happily ended in the recovery of the
    wandering impedimenta, when Richard became himself again.</p>

  <p>No. 2 was Tentmaster-general, and a sportsman to the core. Reindeer,
    salmon, and Gamle Norge&mdash;these he had chronically on the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>brain,
    mixed up with a great love of old tankards and a yearning for silver
    belts and <i lang="nn">gammelt sölv</i>. Once in his Norfolk jacket and knickers, <i lang="nn">pua
    de höie fjelde</i>, how happy was he! rejoicing in the <i lang="nn">friske luft</i>,
    mountain air, and snow peaks (<i lang="nn">snebræer</i>), ready for any amount of
    fatigue, and always willing to cook first and eat afterwards. A rare
    good man was the Tentmaster.</p>

    <div class="larger-version">[<a href="images/i_027f_big.jpg">See larger version</a>]</div>
  </div>

  <p>No. 3 was generally known as “the Locust,” from his constant appetite
    for all kinds of food, and general thirst for knowledge about
    everything connected with Norway. Note-book in hand, he was ever
    jotting down everything, even to catching mosquitoes between the leaves
    of it, so as to bring home the real thing. Still No. 3 had an important
    duty to perform. As the travellers were three, he was allowed the
    casting vote&mdash;a most wholesome arrangement, as he was a married man,
    and consequently likely to be useful in some weighty matters. Happily,
    to the credit of No. 1 and No. 2, the exercise of No. 3’s prerogative
    was never called for, and by the end of the trip was looked on as a
    sinecure. Still he always travelled ready to apply “a touch of the
    oil feather”&mdash;one of the best companions a traveller can have ready
    to hand. May many such trios have a trip of such great yet simple
    enjoyment, such health, and such pleasing diversion of thought! It is
    a joy to fall back upon throughout life, and the longer the life the
    greater the relish of recollection.</p>

  <p>Hitterdal Church is one of the two wooden churches of which Norway
    can boast, the other being that of Borgund. They are built of wood,
    Byzantine-Gothic, <i>on dit</i>, but grotesque and pagodaist in form. The
    old porches are grandly carved with serpents, dragons, and Runic
    interlacings. The church itself at Hitterdal is nothing like so quaint
    or picturesque as that at Borgund, neither is it so weird; still, its
    early carving forms a noble monument to come down to us, and at once
    draws forth the admiration, not only of the antiquarian, but of the
    casual passer-by. The lintels at the entrance are especially beautiful.
    The bell-tower is unusually detached, in this case being placed on
    the other side of the highway. Unfortunately, time prevented a more
    detailed sketch of the old chair or seat given on <a href="#Page_29">page 29</a>: it stands in
    the church by the altar, and is considered episcopal, but the date is
    most likely <i>circa</i> 900. What grand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> solidity of form! Vikingly to a
    degree, and fit for Thor or Odin. There is a great air of majesty about
    it.</p>

  <p>The roof of the church is also of wood, carved in the same way as many
    of the churches in Sussex, and covered with small wooden tiles, if
    that term may be used to describe the process which in that county is
    generally known as “shingling.”</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>Porch at Hitterdal: Thelemarken.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>The churchyard is very interesting, and the grave-boards have a
    peculiar form worthy of notice; for this reason one is introduced
    here. The shape of the upper part is that of a cross, but below come
    up two horns, rising right and left. These horns have a kind of anchor
    form; and what could be a more appropriate emblem in a country so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
    sea-bound as Norge? The blending of Faith and Hope is, I think, most
    poetically suggested. Can we do better here than pay a tribute of
    respect to the beautiful simplicity of the religious character of the
    Norwegian peasantry? Their love of God and their reverence for religion
    are refreshing, and offer a good lesson to many who rejoice in mere
    flourish of external worship. We shall have occasion to refer to the
    curious anomaly of Roman Catholic vestments continued in the present
    day in the Lutheran service, but allusion may now be made to the happy
    link which exists between the ministers and people. This is shown in
    the character of the sermons, the whole tone of which seems to aim at
    binding the parish together in Christian love and sympathy, bearing
    each other’s burdens, caring for one another, and curbing self&mdash;the
    most difficult of all tasks, as it comes nearest home, and is in itself
    so antagonistic to the inclinations of human nature. The whole climate
    rather tends to develop this frame of mind: there is a certain sedate
    expression throughout the provinces; the long darkness of winter,
    extending its influence even into the continuous light of the northern
    summer, brings every one into close and constant proximity, whilst the
    mountains isolate the valleys one from the other without any access.
    Still, when the summer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> comes and the whole energy of vegetation
    bursts out at once, how their gladdened hearts rejoice! They pluck
    these outbursts of beauty and revived nature, and joyously take them
    to the house of God&mdash;no mere form or ritual, but the wholesome outcome
    of heartfelt, unsophisticated joy and gratitude for brightness after
    lengthened gloom and months of pent-up feeling.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Leaving Hitterdal, we were off in earnest for the Hardanger, with
    a grand country before us. The first night we pulled up at Skeje.
    Before coming to our resting-place at the end of the lake, we noticed
    the saw-mills and corn-mills (seven, one above the other); not that
    torrents are scarce in Norway, but in this valley there was employment.
    Arrived at Skeje, our Tentmaster having selected his spot, tents were
    pitched, and everything put ship-shape for the night. The only milk we
    could get was goat’s milk, and <i>fladbröd</i> in abundance. It is, perhaps,
    superfluous to mention here that <i>fladbröd</i> can be made very toothsome
    by drying it before the fire: the peasants keep it in a state ready for
    travelling, with the means of folding it up so as not to be shaken into
    dust by the jolting of the <i>stolkjær</i>, which certainly would be the
    case had it been fit for eating. The smoke of our fire had gone up, and
    after our meal and a chat with our neighbours we turned in. A strange
    dog came into the Patriarch’s tent, and eventually curled himself up
    for the night, and, as a mark of gratitude for welcome, woke him in the
    morning by licking his face.</p>

  <p>Next day brought us on to Flatdal. Looking over that grand, deep
    valley, we halted awhile at a picturesque wooden house: we asked
    for milk, which was brought forthwith, and it was goat’s milk. The
    daughter, as it was Saturday afternoon, was engaged plaiting her two
    long tails ready for the morrow. The good mother had a very fine
    antique silver brooch, and the proprietor one also on his shirt-front,
    and after we had drunk our milk they showed us their rooms, which
    were most interesting, and dated very far back; for traces of the
    fact presented themselves on all sides, especially in the harness and
    elaborately carved horse-collars, which bore the crest of a lion’s
    head on an escutcheon&mdash;evidently belonging to the days of aristocratic
    Norway.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

  <p>We had bivouacked on a green lawn near the village, close to a house
    which was a carriole station. Our three tents were a novelty, and our
    cooking at last brought a crowd around us; but we must say that the
    people were most kindly and considerate towards us. They had never seen
    such a thing before, and hated <i>fanter</i>, tinkers, and gipsies, which
    nearly included all wanderers in tents: such latter were we.</p>

  <p>Next we inspected the <em>loom</em>, where a daughter was hard at work. There
    were a fine old bed, with inscription, and many spinning-wheels, highly
    coloured (green, red, and blue and white, with black). It is a pity an
    illustration of this room cannot be given in colour. We descended into
    the <i>dal</i>: the heat was intense, no air below, and a pandemonium of
    flies. Bathing under the wheel of a mill was a temporary relief: our
    torment was renewed at lunch. But we were out to enjoy ourselves; so
    we did, in spite of mosquitoes. At lunch we cooked some of the trout
    our chief had killed <i>en route</i>, which that day numbered thirty. We
    were immensely amused here by noticing the very comic and inquiring
    expression in a magpie while listening, for the first time probably,
    to the English snore with which one of our party favoured us on this
    occasion, putting his head first on one side and then on the other,
    then taking a hop, and, when the music broke into a staccato bass
    passage, hopping back still more interested, until it finally flew
    off. Magpies are the sacred birds of the land, and are regarded as the
    private property of his Satanic Majesty.</p>

  <p>After a long day and a mid-day meal, during which we were devoured by
    mosquitoes until nothing was left of us but our monograms, we arrived
    late in the evening in front of a farmhouse at Sillejord. It was
    Saturday night, and no room in the house, but an open space close by,
    most inviting for tents. In the twinkling of an eye the Tentmaster
    issued his order, each man had his tent laid out, and up they went
    simultaneously, to the astonishment of the natives. Was it a sort of
    fair, only read of in books? Was it the first germ of the great Russian
    fair of Nijni Novgorod? Was it one of the lost tribes of Israel come
    down from the clouds? Or were we Germans, who, having already annexed
    Denmark, had just run on with a message from Prince Bismarck to say
    that Norway also was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> annexed? No; the peasants rather looked on at a
    respectful distance, with a certain openness of mouth and absence of
    expression. By this time, the tents being up, beds laid, saddle-bags
    in places, and guns hung on tent-pole with telescope, food had to be
    thought of, and the canteen business looked after. The canteen was well
    organized and an old traveller&mdash;almost self-acting; so accustomed to
    the names of Fortnum and Mason’s tinned soups, &amp;c., that the very words
    “mock-turtle” made it burn and bristle up to a really good fire. That
    night we had good lake trout; and how welcome, with our then appetites,
    the mock-turtle! Three cheers for Fortnum and Mason! And then the
    <i>mörbradsteg</i>! Some of our readers have never been introduced to those
    satisfying and necessary pleasures of life; if not, let us explain.
    <i>Mörbradsteg</i> and other good things in tins come from Stavanger in
    Norway, which is great in potted meats, <i>ryper</i>, tins of all kinds of
    preserved things, soups, lobsters, &amp;c., and these <i>mörbrader</i>. The
    inquiring mind may ask, “But <i>mörbrader</i>&mdash;what is it? how made?” All
    I can say is, that it was so good we thought we had no time to ask
    what it was: perfect in flavour, solid in substance, very satisfying
    to the most energetic of gastric juices, and wholesome. Three cheers,
    therefore, for Stavanger! Then came wild strawberries, brought by dear
    little children in costume, who had already begun to go through the
    process of purification ready for Sunday, biscuits and Dutch cheese,
    and a <i>skaal</i> for Gamle Norge. After this we followed the suggestion of
    the good motto, “Rest and be thankful,” and then some hunters’ songs.</p>

  <p>The following day (Sunday) was a curious scene; everybody came to
    look at us. All the characteristics of national costume, as worn in
    Thelemarken, were in full force. Let us first describe the <i>piger</i>,
    or girls. They wear very short petticoats, and most becoming and
    picturesque they are; dark blue stockings with lovely clocks, and
    buckles on their shoes; the apron is embroidered with what now would be
    called crewel patterns of flowers; while a little below the waist is a
    rich many-coloured girdle, ending in knobs of tassels of the brightest
    colours. The top of the petticoat is bound with a bright colour, and
    shown, as the scarlet jacket, which is frequent in this district, is as
    short as the men’s, coming only a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> little below the shoulder-blades.
    Tucked inside the girdle is generally seen a rich silk handkerchief,
    and in some cases two. The head-dress is another silk handkerchief, and
    into the tail of the back hair more colour is worked. On week days they
    wear large gaiters, like cloth trousers, which certainly attracted our
    attention when first seen.</p>

  <p>Now for the lads of the village. They are not one tittle behind
    the girls in the pains they take as to their points, especially
    these&mdash;shortness of jacket, length of trouser, and brightness of
    colour. At Dabord they all adopted the shaven cheek, upper lip, and
    chin. The jacket is generally white, very short, as in Sætersdalen,
    just coming below the shoulder-blades: this curious garment is turned
    back at the cuffs and <i>revers</i> with light blue, the effect being
    heightened by silver buttons. The trousers are very curious&mdash;a fact
    necessitated by the shortness of the superstructure. The expanse of
    back is prodigious from the shoulder-blades downwards, they are wide in
    the leg, and generally have a stripe down the side. The short coatee
    affords a grand display of tolle-knives, the handles of which, in this
    part, are generally made of <i>lom</i> (maple), smooth, and uncarved, and
    deep in the sheath. In most cases they are suspended from a button, and
    not from a belt; in fact, belts are not of very frequent occurrence
    here. Skull-caps and hats are worn by the men, and the richest farmers
    maintain the national costume of the district. In some few instances
    for weddings the white jacket is daintily touched up with a little
    worked flower here and there on the edge and corner, which gives great
    finish. The clocks on the men’s stockings are very rich: these are worn
    on fête days with breeches, which are worked in red and white round
    the buttons and up the seams. The garters are always objects of great
    taste and careful arrangement. It is when the holiday costumes are worn
    that the beautiful and mysterious Huldre appears, generally frequenting
    the mountains and forests, but sometimes joining in the festive dances
    of the mountaineers. When she vouchsafes this favour every young
    <i>bonde</i> is eager to dance with her&mdash;the handsome strange girl with the
    blue petticoat, and white handkerchief over her head. Tradition does
    not enlighten us much about this beauty, and the story of her sudden
    disappearance immediately her cow-tail is discovered is cruel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
    Why does she come to Thelemarken, where the skirts are so short, sometimes
    only reaching the knee? If she be so fond of dancing, why not frequent
    country balls? Or she would be safer with a train of the present
    fashion; even if that were trodden on, her tail would be safe. Having
    noticed the general costume, let us enjoy the day of rest.</p>

  <p>The brightness of the morning favoured our <i>al fresco</i> toilets, and
    one of our party (who carried a dressing-case full of wonderful
    things, and generally known in the list of impedimenta as “Somebody’s
    luggage”) became the centre of attraction. In front of his tent were
    laid out a waterproof sheet and a saddle-bag, partially opened and
    supported at the back; the latter sustained the looking-glass, in
    front of which knelt a figure shaving (No. 1). Now, although the
    Norwegians shave almost universally, there was something about our
    friend’s manipulations which took the fancy of all present. The girls
    giggled; the short ones tried to peep between the tall ones. Why? Did
    the performer pull his own nose to a greater length than usual in this
    country when he took the long sweep down his cheek? Hardly. The fact
    was, the good folk thought the whole thing was but an overture to
    some other performance, and that the dressing-case, with its numerous
    silver-topped glass bottles, contained all kinds of medicines, panaceas
    for everything&mdash;cures for gout, sciatica, tic douloureux, trichinæ
    spirales, hypochondria, dipsomania, and every other mania.</p>

  <p>After the shaving came a pause. A fortunate inquiry for old silver
    ornaments now changed the whole scene, and for the rest of the day, at
    intervals, the <i>penates</i> of the neighbourhood were being brought for
    our edification. Some of the old brooches were remarkably beautiful;
    the rings were very characteristic, some having small pendant rings,
    some with the usual cup ornaments; and when it was discovered that much
    interest was taken in old costumes, we had really a treat&mdash;embroideries
    on <i>vanter</i>, or winter gloves without fingers, eider-down cloaks,
    swaddling-bands, babies’ caps, worked aprons, the open-work at the
    lower part being admirable in design. A wish was expressed to see a
    baby ready swaddled for baptism. Unhappily, there was no such thing
    to be had within miles upon miles; but rather than “the Locust”
    should be disappointed, these good people dressed up a woollen one,
    which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>answered every purpose, and was considered a great success.
    The kindness of the people was very striking; a certain shy curiosity
    characterized their movements at first, but they soon settled down
    to taking every possible pains to oblige us and meet our wants. It
    seemed very odd, however, to see a church so near, and yet no service.
    How was it, when we saw almost enough people to form a congregation?
    It happened thus. The <i>præstegaard</i>, or clergyman’s house, is at the
    central church, which often has two or three <i>annexer</i>&mdash;small churches,
    each eighteen or twenty miles from the principal one; the services,
    therefore, are only held about every third Sunday in each church.
    Well educated, well read, and, much like the old fathers, revered
    and well beloved by their flocks, the clergy lead a hard life. The
    vast extent of their parishes or districts is very trying to their
    health, necessitating long drives, and in winter much severe sledge
    work; while on the coast there is such boat work that the minister and
    doctor of the locality seem more like “old salts” than members of those
    professions. I remember particularly one clergyman, whose <i>annex</i> was
    on a group of islands off the coast. As the steamer passed she swung
    round a point, when a boat came off to us, with a grand figure standing
    up steering her. From beneath an old sou’-wester streamed his white
    hair, grandly blown back, and he wore silver spectacles, large muffler
    round his throat, oilskin coat and trousers, and long sea boots. As
    the boat neared the steamer and was turned to the gangway, a sailor
    on board said, “Now, sir, you’ll see one of the fine old sort; this,
    sir, is the priest, and not a better seaman will you find all along
    the coast&mdash;nor a better man.” No wonder religion takes so simple and
    earnest a form when its exponents practically exemplify, in their
    every-day life, its sublime teachings with a simplicity, energy, and
    dignity far beyond the conception of those working in densely populated
    districts; for the priest, although but an occasional visitor to some
    parts, is a source of comfort and sympathy to all in their trouble, and
    enters with the greatest interest into their rejoicings and pleasures,
    whether they be public or domestic. In this way their relations with
    their flocks are most “good shepherd-like,” and their constant care and
    solicitude for their parishioners <span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>rivet the love and confidence of
    all around them. No doubt these relations are materially assisted by
    the tolerably equal distribution of this world’s goods in spots remote
    from busy towns; or rather, to speak more correctly, by the absence
    of wealth and the even-manneredness of all such Norwegian residents.
    Any stranger visiting Norway will be struck with the large Elizabethan
    frill worn by the priest, which, with the sombre black gown, and the
    two candlesticks constantly kept on the altar ready to be lighted on
    three occasions&mdash;generally Christmas, the end of the forty days, and
    Easter&mdash;imparts a very mediæval character to the service. All that we
    have here said of the relations of the clergy with their congregations
    is abundantly confirmed by the homely way in which the former give
    out the notices from the altar as to the working of the parish or
    the schools, or any extra communion, when requested by any of the
    parishioners.</p>

  <p>Going to Berge from Sillejord, we had torrents of rain&mdash;a deluge: we
    now approached higher ground and a blacker country. Snow ploughs on the
    side of the road told tales of wintry difficulty of transit, while
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>sledges were round most of the houses. Arrived at the station, we
    found one small bedroom with strong store-closet atmosphere, game lost,
    &amp;c. In the <i>vand</i> are perch; in the river, greyling. The hunter and
    <i>bonde</i> here was building a large room, which, though still unfinished,
    we decided to sleep in. We soon had a roaring fire; the beds were made,
    the Patriarch slinging his hammock under a huge carpenter’s bench;
    then came the cooking, followed by a few songs; and finally stories of
    bears, wolves, wild cats, and lynxes from the <i>bonde</i>. There was a very
    fine old <i>mangletræ</i> here, two feet long. So peculiar an instrument
    of Norwegian household necessity is deserving of explanation: it is
    two feet long and four inches wide: <span class="smcap">b</span> represents the things
    to be mangled; <span class="smcap">c</span> the roller; the right hand of the mangler
    takes hold of the lion at <span class="smcap">d</span>, and the left hand on <span class="smcap">a</span>
    balances the <i>mangletræ</i>, which is worked backwards and forwards until
    the things are done. <i>Mem.</i>&mdash;Last night reindeer were seen above here;
    and at the <i>vand</i>, high over this place, the <i>bonde</i> had seen a glutton
    after a wounded or sick reindeer. The chief brought in three trout for
    breakfast. Now the real life was bursting on us. How we drank in the
    stories of the hunter, rising in the morning to delight in the health
    and beauties about us!</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow60" id="i_037">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_037.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>At Mogen we found more signs of winter&mdash;sledges abundant, and one
    pigsty kind of hut surmounted by a wonderful group: snow shoes, old
    reindeer horns and heads, sledges, and a plough.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
    This is primitive;
    but it is not all: there were the old querns, or <i>haandkværn</i>. In spite
    of this we had not shaken the influence of travelling civilisation;
    the <i>bonde</i> asked us if we would like some “Bockley and Pukking’s
    black-brown beer.” Certainly. “Men hvor meget?” Two and sixpence per
    bottle: it had been left by an Englishman. Eheu, what an anomaly!</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a>
    The iron of this plough is exactly the same as the
    hand-plough, or “casarhome,” used in the Western Highlands, and now
    fast disappearing.</p>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Jamsgaard.</span>&mdash;This was such an evening: north wind strong, bad
    for tents; large lawn discovered, camp inside; camp beds fitted up,
    cooking outside. The hammock was slung. How the north wind whistled,
    until we barricaded that side with hay! Then we all slept. In the
    morning we were to start early, and the perfect dignity with which the
    page entered the dormitory, with coffee for all, was truly a picture.
    We got a very good pony here, a true <i>bakken</i>, with black-centred hog
    mane, and zebra-marked legs, and started in lovely weather by the
    crystally clear Totak Vand, where we saw a large white owl; then to the
    larger Toftland, and on to Botten. We are now in snow-shoe land, with
    spills of birch-wood for pipes, and more mills, one over the other,
    for grinding. Grouge Kirk was interesting; and we saw a woman rowing
    over with homespun, to be sent to some commercial centre. Starting
    in a <i>stolkjær</i>, Botten is a good high-latitude station: bleak to a
    degree. The snow was close to the house, but within all one could wish:
    preserved meat, reindeer flesh, port wine, but no white bread; looms,
    spinning-wheels, snow shoes; many old ale bowls, saddles, carved boxes;
    and, at one end of the barn, boughs of trees brought up from the <i>dal</i>
    for the magpies to build in; at the other end a bunch of wheat, also
    brought up and placed on a pole for the birds. After leaving Botten we
    started for Haukelid Sæter, and found the men working on a new road
    to the Hardanger. As they progress, large monoliths are put up at
    intervals with the date of construction, and sometimes the elevation
    above the sea; here it is 2,800 feet, and at this point very large
    Scotch firs are found in skeleton state, monuments of a past period of
    giants.</p>

    Haukelid Sæter is 3,500 feet above the sea. Here we had the
    pleasure of meeting the Norwegian engineer of the road, and in the
    <i>vand</i> below were floating masses of ice. In the morning the <i>vand</i> was
    frozen (July 15), so that we could not cross in a boat, but had to go
    round. Near this was the scene of a reindeer slaughter by natives: they
    had a Remington breech-loading rifle; drove a herd into a <i>botten</i>, or
    <i>cul-de-sac</i>, and shot forty in six days&mdash;nine in one day; but we shall
    refer to this later on. On our journey we found the bridge carried
    away, and had to ford, which was great fun. We sent a knowing old pony
    over first. How we enjoyed it&mdash;one might have taken us for schoolboys
    out for a holiday&mdash;in and out of the water! One poor pony, however, did
    not find it agree with him, the ice-water was so cold, and for a time
    he was very bad indeed.</p>

  <p>Once more in the flat of the valley, it seemed like old times, and we
    thought a hearty meal at Seljestad would do us good. In the latter
    respect, however, we were doomed to disappointment, meeting with
    nothing but picturesqueness and some costume, in which red bodices
    were conspicuous; so we had to fall back on potted meats and biscuits.
    Whilst waiting we saw some peasants <i>en route</i> for their <i>sæter</i>, with
    all their milk apparatus. The only good thing we got was a pony&mdash;a
    beauty&mdash;to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>go down this grand valley, and drive, one may say, through
    the Laathe Fos. At this point there are three falls in view of each
    other&mdash;Laathe Fos, Espeland Fos, and Hildal Fos. This we enjoyed, and
    late at night, or rather early in the morning&mdash;for it was one o’clock
    when we got into the boat to go down the Sanden Vand and row to
    Odde&mdash;having had such a good day, we sang “God save the Queen” and many
    songs about Rensdyr, Jagt, Norwegian love, “det kjære Hjem,” &amp;c.</p>

  <p>In the morning we arose, and before breakfast read the following
    encouraging entry in the Dagbog:&mdash;“Wel Satisfed everything is good
    order;” and so we found it.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>Seljestad.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>Roldal itself is very beautiful. Our guide (Knut) returned to Haukelid,
    and next morning we left the lensmand’s house for a very long day,
    hoping, if possible, to reach Odde. At Hore we could only obtain some
    sour milk, and then started over the snow for Seljestad, when we
    noticed an old <i>bonde</i> preparing barley for brewing, assisted by his
    wife, with a scarlet body to her jacket. About two <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we
    saw a grand effect of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>double solar rainbow&mdash;blue sky, no cloud.
    The sky between the inner and outer circles, which were complete, was
    deep lavender. This was seen from the head of the pass, above 3,500
    feet, with snow all round us. As we came down we cut our road, and
    after lunch, on arriving at the outburst of snow-water, we were all
    wild enough to bathe in it. However, we were none the worse, but, on
    the contrary, much the better for it. Soon after we came on one of the
    grandest bursts in Norway; a deep zigzag went down below us; and we
    looked upon the Gröndal, which is immense, and at the end of which lies
    the vast expanse of the Folgefond. We now began our descent, and worked
    along the valley. The curious part of the fording was this&mdash;that the
    old pony, having taken one man and baggage over, came back by himself,
    so that the “aspirants” might swim over without any load. After this
    we had a long ascent and heavy drag, beneath a scorching sun, over
    the snow, so much of which had not been known for years, to a tiny
    Ligaret <i>sæter</i>. The best thing to counteract the sun’s influence is a
    sou’-wester hind side before.</p>

  </div>

  <p>“Rein” were seen here. Later on, at an altitude of 4,000 feet on a
    bare rock, we partook of dinner, icing our claret <i>au naturel</i> in the
    snow. Soon afterwards we began our descent, and, on leaving the snow,
    found a young girl goatherd with a little bit of costume, showing that
    she belonged to Roldal&mdash;viz. a dark blue cloth cap, with yellow-orange
    border. Then we passed a hunters’ hole or hut, and again forded;
    finally coming, late in the evening, to a spot particularly mentioned
    by Forrester and greatly admired by us&mdash;the old bridge, with torrent
    roaring beneath, and the distant lake at our feet. We all paused, lay
    down, and murmured with delight over the beauties of the spot. Now that
    we had arrived at vegetation, we put leaves inside our caps, and longed
    for glycerine for our faces.</p>

  <p>Norway is grand, picturesque, wild, and bold, its principal features
    being the long arms of the sea running inland for many miles, sea-water
    dashing against the most precipitous façades of rocks, and the
    snow-water, in many instances, coming down from the high ranges, and
    falling straight into the sea itself. These arms of the sea are called
    <i>fjords</i>, and two are especially grand and of immense expanse&mdash;the
    Sogne fjord (the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>larger) and the Hardanger: both of them are rich in
    snow-scapes and waterfalls. The Hardanger is the richer of the two in
    the matter of waterfalls, having two to boast of&mdash;the Vöring Fos and
    the Skjæggedal Fos, sometimes called the Ringedal Fos, as falling into
    the Ringedal Vand. The Vöring Fos, which is approached from Vik, is
    better known than the latter, which is more grand in form and power:
    to reach it one should stop at the end of the fjord. The difficulty
    of access and roughness of road have prevented many from making the
    attempt; still it is well worth any passing discomfort or fatigue to
    have the privilege of communing with nature under such a combination of
    circumstances.</p>

    <img class="w100" src="images/i_044.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>Odde: Hardanger.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>Arrived at Odde, arrangements must be made to remain at least <span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>three or
    four days, so as to visit the following most interesting localities:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. Skjæggedal Fos.</p>

  <p>2. Buerbræ Glacier.</p>

  <p>3. Folgefond.</p>

  <p>4. Gröndal Laathe Fos, and other fosses.</p>

  <p>The immense extent of the snow-fields of the Folgefond should not
    be missed, and for these a day not too bright should be specially
    selected; for pleasant as fine cloudless weather undoubtedly is, still
    nature is not always seen to the greatest advantage in it, and more
    particularly in mountain scenery, where mist and broken cloud relieve
    the various peaks, detach them one from the other by the most delicate
    films, and impart grandeur, endless variety, and size, draping the
    peaks with mystery and majesty. What a delightful sensation is that of
    rising on a fine fresh morning, with the early mist waiting its bidding
    to rise, and the anticipation of a glorious excursion in a mountainous
    country before one! Now for the fos.</p>

  <p>The village of Odde, our starting-place, with its simple church, a
    station for carrioles and boats, its few wooden houses, kind simple
    people, and one lazy-looking sailing craft, or <i>jægt</i>, is fortunate in
    having a young guide, who, following in the steps of his father, has by
    his many good qualities influenced numerous people to visit this most
    excellent place; and all who have been there once seem to wish to go
    again. Our arrival from the Haukelid route, coming down the Gröndal,
    was late; in fact, about two <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Leaving the lake above Odde,
    we first caught sight of the Hardanger fjord, with the village lying
    below, the church in strong relief, and its few buildings against the
    bright water. One felt greatly inclined to sit and muse over such a
    scene, so calm, so peaceful, so solemn, so silent, for no singing
    birds ever chirrup in this northern land, and their absence is most
    noticeable.</p>

  <p>Early in the morning we are up, and, with every promise of fine
    weather and comfort from our “nosebags” (most necessary items for this
    travelling), we start for the Skjæggedal, an excursion which should
    take fourteen hours to do comfortably. What enjoyment can there be,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
    what satisfaction, what knowledge gained in a strange country, if one
    flies through it as if in training for some event or actually engaged
    in athletic sports? The start is made from Odde down the lake to
    Tyssedal, about an hour’s row on the fjord. Soon is seen a white line
    running out from the shore, the boat is caught by the stream and swung
    round, and we near the land in the backwater. This is the exit of the
    snow-water from the fos into the sea-water of the fjord.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow100" id="i_046">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_046.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>Odde: Hardanger.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>Now to begin three hours’ good steady walking up, up, up through
    pine woods, with boot soles polished by slippery needles, now and
    then ledges of rocks, and ofttimes a shelving sweep of smooth rocks,
    dangerous for most people, ticklish for every one, especially should
    they have any tendency to giddiness. In some parts logs have been laid
    in the fissures, and in one place a kind of all-fours ladder; still
    all enjoy it, and glory in the freshness of the trip. After this tough
    walk the upper valley is reached, and the farm, “Skjæggedal Gaard,”
    is in sight. Here we found milk and coffee; the homestead, so lonely
    in winter, now bright in summer light, with peasant farm folk quite
    out of the world, and a singing guide; but even Danjel, with his eagle
    profile, is not always <span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>inclined to sing his best. Perhaps he is
    aware of the report that the priest, having heard that Danjel had
    fallen in love, had forbidden the banns, simply on the score of his too
    strong resemblance to the feathery tribe just mentioned.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow72" id="i_047f">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_047f.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>Skjæggedal Fos.</i></div>
    <div class="larger-version">[<a href="images/i_047f_big.jpg">See larger version</a>]</div>
  </div>

  <p>Leaving the farm, we go down to the boathouse, covered with huge
    slabs of stone to prevent it being blown away by the wintry winds,
    and enter the boat to cross the river at the foot of the fos from the
    Ringedal Vand. Once over, we are soon at the Ringedal Lake, which is
    all snow-water, most crystally clear, and containing no fish, no life,
    on account of its extremely low temperature. On the left of the lake
    is seen high up the Tyssestrængene Fos, as shown under the initial
    letter of our opening chapter. Near the foot of this we stop to go
    up and see the bear self-shooter, or trap, where Bruin, it is hoped,
    may run against a wire which fires two barrels heavily charged&mdash;a bad
    look-out in the future for tourists who eschew guides, as this is
    the only accessible road. At the back is the immense snow expanse of
    the Folgefond, and in front of us we hear a distant roaring thud of
    continuous waters&mdash;our “fall.” Rounding a point, we look up and see
    it. The best time is when the snow-water is in full spate; then it is
    truly majestic. The whole air seems whirled round in eddies; the water
    comes shooting and leaping over, falling in inverted rocket forms,
    half breaking on a ledge of rocks; the foam, the roar, the vast spray,
    everything is soaked and dripping&mdash;the energy of nature in a most
    sublime form, the Skjæggedal Fos itself. We were loath to leave the
    spot, but started off a little taciturn from the impression the scene
    had made on us, and safely returned to receive the kind hospitality of
    our friends at Odde, and next to visit the Buerbræ Glacier.</p>

  <p>This glacier has especial interest for all lovers of nature, from the
    fact of its being not only a new formation or creation, but being
    still in process of development. It is caused by the immense pressure
    of the large snow-fields above in the Folgefond, which bodily weigh
    and force down the ice into the valley. Our good friend Tollefson,
    father of the young guide previously mentioned, was born in the valley
    where the glacier is now gradually carrying all before it. Fifty years
    ago, he told <span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>me, there were no symptoms of ice; gradually it formed
    and advanced&mdash;in 1870, ninety yards; in 1871, four yards in one week;
    and in 1874 a still more rapid progress. When we were there the front
    ice was just ploughing up a large rock and pushing it over; on either
    side the rocks are steep; and throughout the colour of the ice is very
    beautiful, rivalling the hues of the Rosenlain Grindelwald. Where will
    this glacier end? Most likely it will drive steadily on to the lake
    above Odde. Who can tell?</p>

  <p>At the farm was seen a beautiful piece of carving, in the form of a
    salt-box, very old, but well worth preserving. We shall give some
    specimens of native work further on.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>Buerbræ Glacier.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>The costume of this district is very striking and characteristic, the
    chief feature being the head-dress, or cap, called in Norske <i>skaut</i>.
    It is formed of white muslin crimped, the hair hidden by the white band
    over the forehead, the cap rising in a semicircle above the head, while
    the corners fall down the back in a point nearly to the waist; white
    linen sleeves, with scarlet body bound with black velvet; the stomacher
    worked in different coloured beads and bugles; the chemisette fastened
    with old <span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>silver brooches; and the collar joined either by a stud or
    brooch. The apron is equally picturesque. Like the cap, it is of white
    muslin, with three rows of open insertion-work on a pink ground, which
    is generally well thrown up by a dark petticoat, so that the whole
    costume produces a very striking effect.</p>

    <img class="w100" src="images/i_049.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>The Spring Dance: Hardanger.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>These costumes were pleasingly brought together one evening when we
    were invited by Svend Tollefson to a little dance at his mother’s
    house. The father and mother sat together, whilst the younger folk
    were either standing or sitting round. The fiddler was grand both in
    action and eccentricity, with tremendous catgut fire, a few involuntary
    notes trespassing now and then, and producing a stirring effect on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
    dancers. The young Svend, evidently a favourite with the youth and
    beauty of Odde, was continuous in his dancing, principally the Spring
    Dance&mdash;a waltz in which it is most desirable that the swain should be
    taller than the maiden, for the former, holding her hand over her head,
    has to run round the latter as she waltzes. The Halling Dance, in which
    the performer jumps a great height into the air, was attempted out of
    doors, but hardly with success. After each dance the guests partook
    of wine, and on this occasion we had some <i>gammel fiin hvid portvün</i>
    (fine old white port wine). The politeness of the Norwegians is most
    noticeable. After taking wine there was a constant shaking of hands,
    while the host was profusely thanked by, “Tak for vün,” or “Tak for
    mad,” the charm of which is considerably enhanced by the fact that
    these simple-hearted people mean what they say.</p>

    <span class="drop-img illow20"><img src="images/i_053.jpg" alt="O" /></span>DDE
    is situated at the most southern point of the Sör fjord&mdash;the last
    inland effort of the Hardanger; and we left it with regret, although we
    knew there was a new world before us in sea-coast experiences: the most
    bracing sea air, together with the excitement of putting into all kinds
    of out-of-the-way villages nestling behind headlands and huge bastions
    of gneiss, to protect them from the furious gales which lash this coast
    from the south-west. We therefore laid ourselves out for thorough
    enjoyment of steamboat travelling, aided all down the Hardanger by the
    clearest and most lovely weather. We proceeded down the Sör fjord, <i>en
    route</i> to Eide, the boats coming off to the steamer at Utne. Some of
    the costumes were most brilliant in colour. One bright green bodice,
    the edging of which was blended with other colours, bore the palm, and
    everything bespoke joy save the face of the poor girl who wore it.
    She had come to see a brother start for America, and to wish him “God
    speed.” Then away we went from Eide down the Hardanger to Rosendal,
    under the Folgefond. We had looked forward to visiting Rosendal, as the
    last château of Norway. Unfortunately there was not sufficient time
    to land. Sometimes, late in the season, the steamers visit outlying
    spots for cargo, and then <span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>much may be seen, as, for instance, when
    the Bergen steamer calls at the sulphur mines of Varalsoe. On one of
    these occasions we not only had the opportunity of going up to the
    mines, but through them, as five hundred tons of ore were being shipped
    for England. Some people find the steamer journey wearying: there is,
    however, so much information to be gathered from those who come on
    board, generally for short distances, that the local details are always
    worth inquiring into.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>The Market: Bergen.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>The whole of the Hardanger is grand and impressive, the Folgefond, with
    its immensity of snow-spread, being the chief attraction. The peace of
    fine weather makes one almost incredulous of what it is when winter
    storms tear up the fjord, and the now unrippled surface is lashed into
    a fury which defies the stoutest hearts and boats.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

  <p>We are nearing Bergen, and there is a flutter on board as the town
    first opens to view&mdash;<i>mirabile dictu</i>, without rain. On the port side
    is a fort, and apparently there are fortifications on the starboard bow
    too. At last we enter the town.</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Norwegian Fairy and Spirit Lore.</span></h3>

  <p>Before travelling farther we shall do well to prepare ourselves for any
    unexpected apparitions, should such be our good fortune. Let us then
    review their varieties, as we hear them described by some who believe
    they have seen them. They may be classified as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The <i>Trold</i>, or <i>Eventyr Trold</i>&mdash;<i>eventyr</i> meaning “fairy tale”&mdash;is
    more frequently introduced into fairy tales than met by tourists, or
    even sportsmen: <span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>it is very shy of foreigners. This particular class
    is distinguished by having one, two, or three eyes, and sometimes one,
    three, six, or nine heads&mdash;a sort of giant, wild man, or inland Caliban
    of eighteen feet high.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow100">
    <img class="w100" src="images/music_056.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="epub-hide"><a href="music/norway.midi">[Listen]</a></div>
  </div>

  <p>The <i>Bjerg Trold</i>, as the name suggests, frequents the mountains, and
    belongs to the same class as the former, though smaller, attaining a
    height of only twelve feet; in fact, it is a medium male ogre.</p>

  <p><i>The Huldre.</i>&mdash;This is a great fairy-tale mystery&mdash;the refined beauty
    in peasant Hardanger costume, who sometimes appears&mdash;as mentioned in
    our notes on Thelemarken&mdash;at dances and festivities, turning the heads
    of all the beaux of the evening until, in some swing of the spring
    dance, her dread cow-tail is revealed, when she vanishes as the music
    of D. T. A. Tellefsen suggests, leaving many broken hearts behind her.</p>

  <p><i>Nökken.</i>&mdash;Water sprites, generally depicted with Neptune crowns, grey
    beards, and seaweed garments.</p>

  <p><i>Nisser.</i>&mdash;These are the mischievous little rascals who are always up
    to tricks here, there, and everywhere, and are closely allied to the
    sprites known in the Romsdal fjelds as the Höboken. These latter are
    seriously spoken of as existing, and having blue heads; and while up at
    the <i>sæters</i> a spare place inside is invariably left for them by the
    <i>piger</i>. The Nisser are depicted with grey clothes, long beards, short
    bodies, and red caps; the shortness of the body recalling to our minds
    a remark of days gone by, “Perhaps Mr. Nobody did it.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

  <p><i>Hauge folket</i> are a combination of Huldre and Nisser.</p>

  <p><i>Tufti folket</i> are a peculiar variety of Nisser.</p>

  <p><i>Drangen</i> are the ghosts or spirits of drowned persons.</p>

  <p>Having classified these mystic folk, we can only hope that the
    information we have culled from authentic and local sources will not
    only help those who have already read Norwegian legends, but give a
    zest to those that may be forthcoming in future translations. Those
    interested in early witches will find details of Craca, the witch
    of Norway, in Olaus Magnus, “De Gentibus Septentrionalibus,” a work
    probably well known to our immortal bard Shakspere, as Craca was great
    in using “venomous moisture of snakes.” A caldron, too, was the common
    instrument of witches, wherein they boiled juices, herbs, worms, and
    entrails for enchantments.</p>

  <p>Norwegian fairy tales are numerous, and traces of Trold lore are found
    all through the provinces, and constantly referred to in every-day
    life; at least, so we found. It is, however, possible that “the wish
    was father to the thought,” and that we rather courted than avoided
    referring to them. Unfortunately they came not, although a rattle
    of flying rocks down a <i>couloir</i> was always attributed to them. We
    shall not find them in Bergen, that is certain; only Huldre appears
    in public, and she coyly at the festivities: she delights not in
    war-paint, <i>gibuses</i>, or opera hats.</p>

  <p>Olaf Kyrre, the old Norse king, built, or rather developed, Bergen into
    a town about 1070. Easy of access, and naturally adapted as a centre
    for trade, it has now become the most important commercial town of the
    west coast. The principal tradition of Bergen is, that ever since the
    introduction of umbrellas every little Bergenite has been presented
    with one as soon as born, another being bestowed by the godfathers and
    godmothers at confirmation; and it is only reasonable to suppose that
    at a wedding every one gives the bride a Sangster or a Gamp, according
    to circumstances. Anyhow, it is an indisputable fact that umbrellas are
    plentiful in Bergen, and, when not devoted to keeping off the rain,
    they serve as a screen against the occasional visits of the sun. No
    doubt this humidity is owing to the position of the town, which lies
    between two <span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>mountains not less than 2,500 feet high, upon and around
    which Jupiter Pluvius reigns supreme.</p>

  <p>Passing from the climate, we must notice the town or city. Approaching
    it from the fjord, it looks picturesque and busy, with merchantmen,
    steam tugs, steam launches, and coasting steamers entering the
    harbour. On the left is the old castle or palace, with the remains of
    its banqueting hall, supposed to have been built by Olaf at the same
    time as the church. On the right is the landing-place for steamers,
    above which, on a part of the town abutting on the fjord and forming
    a continuation of the principal street, is a fort. Proceeding farther
    down the harbour, with the churches before us, on the left we pass the
    ship-building yard, and come upon a long line of white wooden houses
    with wharfs in front of them&mdash;a busy scene, fraught with energy and
    <i>bouquet de stokfiske</i>. Alongside lie the Nordland <i>jægts</i>, or vessels
    which bring the fish down dried from the Lofoden Islands, and their
    crews are in close commercial relationship with the owners of the white
    wooden structures which are known by the name of the Hanseatic Houses.
    Olaf Kyrre had favoured the Scotch with certain privileges for trading
    at Bergen, but in after years the Hanseatic League made great efforts
    in the same direction, and successfully; for in 1228 they settled and
    began to trade in Bergen, and by some extraordinary means ousted the
    Scotch and English entirely by 1312, when they were left in their
    trading glory. They soon developed the vast fishing trade of Nordland,
    and made Bergen the great commercial centre which it now is, receiving
    dried cod-fish and roes from the north. These are sent, in exchange for
    wine, corn, iron, and so forth, to Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Spain,
    England, and various parts of the Mediterranean, but especially to
    the Roman Catholic countries. Still, these German merchants were not
    entirely happy; they, the Hanseatics, located together on one side of
    the harbour, were not much liked by the youth and beauty of the Bergen
    proper side of the town, receiving from the Norske <i>piger</i>, or Bergen
    beauties, the characteristic and appropriate <i>sobriquet</i> of “Pepper
    Youngsters” (<i>Pfeffer Junkers</i>), which still clings to them.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Bergen must have been very imposing in appearance in the old times,
    when the large Hanseatic craft were warping out of the entrance of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>harbour, with their high quarter-deck and taffrail-deck lamps,
    squarely rigged three masts and steeving bowsprit, jack-yard and
    water-sail, long pennons and streamers from the yard-arms, the sides
    of the vessel falling well in, and the guns bristling to frighten any
    who might take a fancy to the good cargo on board. Now the Hanseatic
    League is a matter of ancient history, but it did its work well, and
    will not soon be forgotten. Bergen is at present the source of supply
    to all places to the north of it, and in itself is interesting to the
    visitor as being a centre of costume&mdash;that charming relic of days
    almost bygone, when each district had its distinctive dress and its
    special form of silver ornament, which, however quaint, or, to go
    further, even ugly, still commanded favour by the respect its presence
    offered to those who had gone before, and most likely had worn it. The
    costumes are well seen at the market, when the farmers, or <i>bönder</i>,
    come in with farm produce, bringing their wives and daughters, with
    the milk in wooden kegs formed like churns, with leather stretched
    over the top, and hoops pressed down tightly to keep it from spilling.
    These milk-cans are carried by the women on their backs, with straps
    or ropes, like knapsacks. One costume is very noticeable here, that
    of the fish-girls. It consists of a dark blue petticoat and jacket,
    a kind of Scotch bonnet well pulled over the head, with a white
    edging of cap coming a little down and showing all round, and roll
    upon roll of kerchief round their necks. Robust, pictures of health,
    and muscular, how they row! When their husbands or brothers are with
    them they row all the same, being quite capable of the first law
    of nature&mdash;self-preservation. They work hard and in earnest, and
    always look <i>bien soignées</i>. For flow of language the early fish
    market conveys a good idea of the activity of the tongue and power of
    gesticulation&mdash;features of life not common to Norway. The boats are all
    down below, and the purchasers, generally domestic servants, hang over
    the woodwork above, craning their necks and stretching down, pointing
    first to this, and then to that, and possibly pushed aside ere long by
    some one else worming in for a bargain.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the fishermen in the boats are taking it very quietly,
    sorting their fish, feeling that their purchasers can be supplied
    <i>strax</i>. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>Now this word in the dictionary is described thus:&mdash;“<i>Strax</i>,
    directly or immediately.” Practically, in Norwegian life, the traveller
    finds that it is no such thing, <i>strax</i> being a movable feast&mdash;so
    movable that it is impossible to say where it will be. It is not even
    so sure as the “Coming, sir,” mumbled by a flying waiter in the midst
    of a crowd of customers about one o’clock; for in the latter case, if
    you wait until two o’clock, you feel there is a probability looming,
    but with a Norwegian <i>strax</i>, especially if applied to getting horses
    for carrioles, it may be hours, or, in the words of what was thought a
    charming song in our younger days, though now half forgotten, “It may
    be for years, or it may be for ever.”</p>

  <p>Bergen is especially associated with the registers of the sea serpent;
    therefore the subject should be referred to here. Crews and captains
    have voluntarily sworn to having seen in various parts of the ocean
    strange monsters of the deep, usually of serpentine form; and judging
    from the illustrations in that interesting work by Olaus Magnus the
    Goth, “De Gentibus Septentrionalibus” (dated <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1530), the
    sea monsters depicted therein were enough to frighten any artist,
    particularly if he were on the spot where the said creatures were
    visible. Still many wonders of the deep may be studied with advantage
    at the Bergen Museum. Lately this institution has been brought
    prominently to light, thanks to the energy of M. Lorange, who has
    found a grand field for his enthusiasm in Scandinavian relics, flint
    implements, and specimens of the “glorious Viking period.” But we must
    not be carried away by this interesting topic from paying due attention
    to a strange-looking creature in this museum, which is kept in spirits
    and labelled&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <div class="center">“<span class="smcap">Silde Konge</span> (<i>Gymnetrus Glesue Ascanius</i>).</div>

    <p>“Length (dried), without tail, 12 feet. Depth, 1 foot. Head blunt,
      square. Bristles, or capillaries, 3 feet; 8 from above, 6 under the chin.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The whales are very fine and enormous specimens, being eighty feet
    long. Why, then, should there not be gigantic <i>silder</i>? A Highlander
    was once speaking of the grandeur and size of Scotland, when a remark
    was made that the area was small. “Tout, tout, mon! But if you saw it
    rolled out, just think what it would be then!” So, were we to roll out
    a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>ninety-foot whale, should we not have as good a sea serpent as any
    newspaper might desire?</p>

  <p>Now that costume is being fast swept away, the old silver of Norway
    bought up by travelling dealers for the town silversmiths to export,
    the old carving replaced by cheap feather-edge boarding, and the
    <i>mangel brats</i> chased away by “Baker’s patent” or some other brand-new
    patent, a general national museum like this of Bergen becomes
    especially desirable, and even necessary, for retaining in the country
    itself its own characteristics. In flint weapons it is especially
    rich, thanks to M. Lorange, who has opened many tumuli with reverence
    and care, his perfect knowledge of the subject being a guarantee that
    nothing will be overlooked. Natural history, too, is well represented.
    The corals found at the entrances to the fjords are astonishing,
    immense, being more like shrubs in size. The Runic inscriptions
    and carvings, portals, and chairs are most interesting; while the
    church decorations of early Christian periods, the ironwork, arms,
    and numismatic records, so useful as collateral history and in the
    assignment or corroboration of the dates of tumuli, are well cared for.
    Most heartily, therefore, do we wish success to the national collection
    now so happily commenced, and so full of promise.</p>

  <p>The somewhat modern appearance of Bergen and the absence of old wooden
    houses are attributable to the disastrous fires which have raged from
    time to time in different parts of the city; in fact, so much was
    destroyed by the great fire in 1702, that nearly the whole of the town
    has been rebuilt, except the old Hanseatic houses. Neither has Bergen
    escaped its share of scourges, for the black pestilence made sad havoc
    about 1348 or 1350, and the plague destroyed immense numbers about 1620.</p>

  <p>Although Bergen is the most important fish mart in Norway, it will
    be better to give a detailed description of its working, extent, and
    season, when we arrive at the Lofoden fishing grounds and islands,
    and the coast of Heligoland and Salten. It seems curious that these
    slow-sailing <i>jægts</i> should come five hundred miles with their cargo
    of fish, when Trondhjem, Molde, and Aalesund are close to hand; but
    on consideration it will be easily understood what an advantage it
    must be for them to get a quick and ready sale for their fish, and a
    selection of every kind of produce from <span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>the warmer climates of the
    Mediterranean, or even the West Indies. Whether articles of necessity
    or luxury, Bergen can supply anything, from a marlinespike to a sea
    serpent.</p>

  <p>The museum of antiquities at Bergen now deserves attention, and
    in it the Nordfjord is brought especially before us, as we shall
    see hereafter. In the meantime we will turn to a few chronological
    landmarks in the early days of Gamle Norge, which will be most
    valuable, as the catena of Scandinavian history is complete in
    specimens of the different periods, corroborated by the archæological
    treasures of Denmark, now so admirably arranged by Professor Worsaae
    in the museum at Copenhagen, and the collection of antiquities at
    Stockholm. Having followed out these different periods, we need only
    casually refer to the objects themselves when we come to the districts
    where they were originally discovered or still exist.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow75" id="i_062">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_062.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>Church Candlestand: Bergen Museum.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p><i>The Flint Period.</i>&mdash;For a long time it was supposed that Norway
    had no stone period: now flint implements of beautiful surface and
    exquisite finish are found up to lat. 65°, beyond which, and near the
    North Cape, the implements are of hard schist, the local formation of
    that part. Among these specimens are found of arrow and spear heads,
    and knives. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>hammers are generally made of whatever the rock of
    the country may be. This use of hard schist for stone implements is
    corroborated by discoveries in similar latitudes in Sweden and Finland.
    A very fine dolmen is still in existence at Frederickshald, in the
    south of Norway&mdash;a spot which, to judge from the number of tumuli in
    the neighbourhood, generally placed on rising ground within view of
    the sea, is a perfect cemetery. Their average height is about 3 feet 6
    inches to 4 feet, and length about 35 feet. Near Stavanger the flint
    implements are of exquisite finish.</p>

  <p><i>The Bronze Period.</i>&mdash;It is interesting to associate this period with
    two systems of burial, namely, Inhumation and Cineration.</p>

  <p><i>Inhumation.</i>&mdash;Wooden coffin&mdash;a tree scooped out; at the bottom was
    placed a bullock’s skin, on which the hero was laid in his garments,
    and with his arms by his side. An instance occurred in which the
    following items were preserved quite perfectly:&mdash;A <i>vadmel</i>; a kind of
    Phrygian cap; a wool plaid and petticoat, or rather kilt, to the knee;
    a small box; a comb; and a bronze sword and knife. These, with a belt
    for the waist, convey a vivid idea of the costume of the period.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow100" id="i_063">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_063.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>Knife-stone on Bronze Belt: Bergen Museum.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Cineration.</i>&mdash;Flint stones seem to have been the base of the grave,
    which was about seven feet long. Remains of cinders prove that the skin
    of some animal was first laid down, then the body with extra garments,
    in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>the cinders of which the bones were found, accompanied by a bronze
    sword, with sheath; two knives of bronze; and a cube of wood, not
    burnt. The bronze implements are so generally known that it is not
    necessary to illustrate them.</p>

  <div class="figleft illow40" id="i_064">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_064.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>Hard Schist implements: North Cape.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p><i>The Iron Period.</i>&mdash;During this period the tumuli were consumed on
    elevated positions within view of the sea; the bones discovered are
    burnt, the ashes being in urns. The objects burnt with them were
    generally small ornaments of bronze or iron, the workmanship of which
    betrays no Roman influence. Sometimes, also, glass vessels were
    consumed, as globules of melted glass have been occasionally found.
    In other cases the ashes are in bronze vases, showing a transition
    state. Should there, however, be any swords, they are bent and twisted,
    and are undoubtedly attributable to Roman influence, as some of the
    bronze vases bear Roman inscriptions. The next stage covered a large
    space, and was characterized sometimes by cineration, and sometimes
    by inhumation. In the latter case the objects are placed with great
    care after the old Roman manner, and consist of urns of burnt clay,
    bronze, and glass; ornaments, arms, &amp;c. Here we have not only actual
    Roman work, but Norwegian imitations, such as bracteates, which have
    been found with Byzantine moneys struck about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 450 or 500.
    This brings us to an important epoch in Scandinavian history, which
    is very ably described by Dexter Hawkins, Esq., in a pamphlet on the
    Anglo-Saxon Race, being an address read by him before the Syracuse
    University, June 21, 1875:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <div class="center">“<span class="smcap">The Anglo-Saxon Race.</span></div>

    <p>“A providential event, not originating from themselves, but from
      a Roman emperor who intended no such results, occurred at the
      close of the third century, which, by directing the attention of
      the Saxons to maritime exploits on a larger scale, with greater
      prospects, and to more distant <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>countries than before, exerted an
      important influence upon their own destiny and that of Europe, and
      finally of America.</p>

    <p>“The Emperor Probus, harassed by the annual incursions of the
      barbarous hordes around the Euxine, now the Black Sea, transplanted
      a large body of various tribes, including Saxons from the vicinity
      of the Elbe, to that region to serve as a protection against
      future inroads. But the attachment of mankind to the scenes of
      their childhood, and their ardent longing when in foreign lands
      for the country their relatives inhabit, where their most pleasing
      associations have been formed, where their individual characters
      have been acquired, and customs like to their own exist, are
      feelings so natural to every bosom, and so common to every age,
      that it is not surprising that these exiles longed to return to
      their native wilds. Impelled by this desire, they seized the
      earliest opportunity of abandoning their foreign settlements and
      possessing themselves of the ships lying in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>the adjacent harbours;
      they formed the daring plan of sailing back to the Rhine, though
      they were more than two thousand miles distant by sea, with no
      charts, compass, or pilots, and ignorant of the many islands, and
      shoals, and currents of the Black and Mediterranean Seas. Compelled
      to land wherever they could for supplies, safety, and information,
      they ravaged the coasts of Asia and Greece. Arriving at Sicily,
      they attacked and plundered its capital with great slaughter.
      Beaten about by the winds, often ignorant where they were, seeking
      subsistence, pillaging to obtain it, and excited to new plunder
      by the successful depredations they had already committed, they
      carried their hostilities to several districts of Africa. They
      were driven off that continent by a force sent for that purpose
      from Carthage. Turning towards Europe, they passed the pillars of
      Hercules, sailed out into the Atlantic Ocean, rounded the Iberian
      peninsula, crossed the stormy <span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>Bay of Biscay, passed through the
      British Channel, and finally terminated their remarkable voyage by
      reaching their fatherland at the mouth of the Elbe.</p>

    <p>“This wonderful expedition discovered to these adventurers and to
      their neighbours, to all, in short, who heard, and had the courage
      to imitate, that from the Roman colonies a rich harvest of spoil
      might be gathered if sought for by sea. It removed the veil of
      terror that hung over distant oceans and foreign expeditions; for
      these exiles had desolated every province almost with impunity.
      They had plunder to exhibit sufficient to fire the avarice of every
      spectator. They had acquired skill which those who joined them
      might soon inherit. On land the Roman tactics and discipline were
      generally invincible; but at sea they were comparatively unskilled
      and weak. The Saxons perceived this, and immediately turned their
      whole attention to naval warfare. Like their American descendants,
      they were cunning and apt at whatever they undertook. Their navy
      became so <span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>effective in a few years that every country in Europe
      bordering on the sea had contributed to their wealth, and they
      annoyed the Roman commerce to such a degree that large fleets
      were fitted out against them, and an officer appointed by the
      Romans as early as the beginning of the fifth century styled ‘The
      Superintendent of the Saxon Shore.’ These exploits had filled their
      island with wealth.”</p>

  <p>A very interesting antiquarian discovery was made in 1877 close to a
    village in Sealand, some twenty miles from Copenhagen, of which the
    following are the most important details:&mdash;About three yards below
    the ground a grave was discovered, surrounded and covered by large
    monoliths, the grave being about six yards long and two yards wide, and
    the floor consisting of rough oaken planks, on which were found the
    remains of a female in a mummified state. Round the head of the body
    were placed several glass cups, one of which bore an inscription, in
    Greek characters, signifying “Good luck to you,” and in other cups were
    found the remains of various kinds of fish, as well as a gold coin of
    the reign of the Roman Emperor Probus. A solid ring of gold encircled
    the neck, and a heavy pin of the same metal was also found close to
    the body, as well as a couple of finger rings. At the feet were placed
    several vessels hollowed out of oak, in which were deposited the bones
    of various animals, especially young pigs, and in one of these basins
    were discovered forty-two dice burned in bone. In the earth round this
    tomb were discovered the remains of several human beings lying in
    great disorder, and it is supposed that the bones are those of slaves
    sacrificed to the manes of the deceased lady. It is thought probable
    that this tomb dates as far back as the third or fourth century after
    Christ.</p>

  <p>With regard to the initial letter at the head of this chapter, it
    is from a remarkable specimen of Runic wood-carving&mdash;part of an old
    episcopal seat&mdash;which will be more fully described when considering
    that class of work, of which we find such interesting specimens in the
    museums of Norway, especially that of Bergen, and which happily are
    well preserved for our study and guidance.</p>

    <span class="drop-img illow25"><img src="images/i_073.jpg" alt="T" /></span>RAVELLING
    in Norway is principally carried on by carriole, row boat,
    and steamer. From the immense extent of seaboard the latter mode has
    naturally been much practised and developed, more especially as the
    Government has not only countenanced it, but encouraged it in every
    possible way. Our route in this excursion involves the adoption of
    this mode of conveyance, and we leave Bergen, with all its interesting
    monuments, associations, costumes, and commercial interests, to wend
    our way up the coast to the north. Starting from the port, with its
    varieties of shipping from all parts of Europe, its Nordlander <i>jægts</i>
    always prominent, its churches standing well out from the moist haze
    and smoke of the city, a scene at all times picturesque, we soon settle
    down for steamboat travelling. On this occasion there was a very
    unusual bustle at the mouth of the port, a fresh breeze was blowing,
    and a small schooner yacht was being towed out for a trial trip. From
    the amount of bunting and excitement, not only on board the yacht, but
    on shore and on our steamer, this was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>evidently a great event. With
    sails all ready to be hoisted as soon as the hawser was let go, one
    would imagine that chase was about to be given to a smuggler, or that
    a Viking had appeared in the offing. It was, however, only for a sail,
    and our little coast steamer was soon away by herself, ploughing in
    loneliness through the fjord. And now for the healthy pleasant delights
    of sea-coast trips.</p>

  <p>With our luggage quietly stowed awaiting our bidding, and a calm
    satisfaction that the steamer was well found, our meals punctual and
    plenteous, our captain well up to his work, the steward anxious to take
    care of us, and our travelling companions likely to be agreeable&mdash;the
    Norwegians being kindly to strangers who are courteous to them&mdash;there
    is but one drawback to the steamer work. It occurs in the fore part
    of the vessel, and is occasioned thus. A <i>skaal</i> (health) for Gamle
    Norge is a very good thing and a noble sentiment, but if too often
    repeated, with the usual accompaniments, it becomes offensive. The
    peasants come on board at the numerous stations, and can procure every
    variety of spirit which is unobtainable on shore. They therefore
    make the most of their opportunity, and soon the demon of our own
    land&mdash;inebriation&mdash;appears, bringing discomfort to the recipient,
    disgust and misery to his surroundings, and finally a besotted and
    wrecked old age; for, although strong constitutions may resist its
    inroads for a time, they must inevitably succumb at last, and pay the
    penalty. Either the victim is quarrelsome or maudlingly stupid: the
    demon makes his mark in so many ways. The natural expression of the
    features is no more to be found; the eye loses its brightness, its
    sweetness is changed for heavy moistness, its telegraphic and sensitive
    expression has vanished; the lips, before so full of character, are no
    longer the exponents of subtle feeling; the hand trembles, the feet
    shuffle, the whole frame is limp, the muscles are flaccid, and the
    brain muddled to futile dreaming. If this be a curse in public, what
    must it be when it invades a home! Well may the wife long to see her
    husband freed from this evil spirit and restored to his former noble
    nature!</p>

  <p>But let us turn to the feast to which nature invites us. At every
    moment the sea-scape changes, new peaks open to us, the clouds are
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>massing ready to be gilded by the setting sun, and soon we have
    the heavens in a blaze of fiery glory and impressive grandeur. As we
    approach the outlying islands we find strong glacial markings, less
    vegetation, and the characteristics of the line of route, all up
    the west coast of Norway, can be carefully and comfortably studied
    by the most moderate sailors, as the islands keep the steamer track
    quite smooth, and it is only when the entrance of some large fjord is
    passed that any motion is felt or any rolling occurs. The villages
    generally nestle close to the waterside, the church in the centre,
    and the <i>præstegaard</i> close by; but a variation occurs in one village
    particularly: the church answers the double purpose of God’s service
    and the fisher’s beacon, and is placed well upon the top of the hill.
    Many are the excuses made by professing Christians for not going to
    church, but the difficulty of access to the one in question, while
    frequently causing the pilgrim to utter the cry of “Excelsior,” at the
    same time elicits the mental avowal that he would be very thankful if
    it were lower.</p>

  <p>In making this passage those who are in Norway for the first time must
    be struck by seeing that both sides of the vessel are sometimes within
    three feet of the bare rocks, which descend precipitously into the
    sea. No wonder, then, that the old woodcuts of the sixteenth century
    show large rings in the face of sea rocks for the vessels to moor
    to.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
    One part of the coast near Steensund is most barren: the masses
    of rock, entirely rounded by ice in past ages, seem to be too smooth
    for vegetation to get a footing. The spot, however, finds favour with
    lobsters, which seem to thrive here, ultimately finding themselves in
    England, and ending their days with a garnishing of parsley. Even for
    lobsters, however, travelling is very expensive, for the difference
    between their price in England and Norway is simply astonishing.</p>

  <p>On some parts of the west coast red deer are found, and now that
    these animals are scarce, it seems a pity they should be in danger of
    extermination. Better far would it be if the <i>chasseur</i> had sufficient
    strength of mind and self-denial to induce him to give these last
    of their race such a respite, or series of closed seasons, as would
    enable them to increase in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>number. One fine head came on board&mdash;a very
    healthy, powerful horn, and royal on both sides. The beam was much
    thicker than it usually is in the horns of stags killed in Scotland,
    and very grand in form. The haunch weighed thirty-eight pounds English,
    so that it must have been a “gude beastie.”</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>Ousen.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>After passing the entrance of the Sogne fjord and experiencing a
    little rolling, we sighted the island of Alden, a very imposing mass
    of rock, supposed to resemble a lion’s head; and, fortunately for us,
    there was less mist rolling around it than usual. It would have been
    a sad disappointment had we only had its whereabouts suggested to us,
    which is the fate of many who are anxious to see it. Our wholesome
    little craft soon leaves Alden far behind, running up Dalsfjord to
    the eastward; we begin to worm our way through narrow passages, with
    the rocks nearer than ever to her sides; and at last we leave her to
    take a boat, in order that we may row up to Ousen, a lovely spot, with
    such garden roofs and such a farmhouse and buildings! The spot where
    we landed is shown in the woodcut. The river was of the most beautiful
    soda-water-bottle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span> colour, the wooden buildings topped with the mountain
    ash in all its gala beauty of bright clusters of berries. The beams
    used in the construction of the houses were very old and remarkably
    massive, and the size of the Sea House suggests the importance of this
    locality as a centre for general merchandise. We arrived here about
    three in the morning, and the servant at the farmhouse showed us to our
    rooms, which had a weird ghostly appearance from their bareness, size,
    and height. The old staircase testified that it had once been well kept
    up; and then, as we looked about for some indication of date, we at
    last found a good specimen of a snaphance pistol of about 1625, which
    tallied well with the period we had already assigned to the house.
    We had now left the sea for a time, and after a few hours’ rest the
    Tentmaster-general reported everything ready for a start; and soon we
    were <i>en route</i> for Sande.</p>

    <p>Sande is a place of sweet waters to the traveller. After rough roads,
    bad beds, sparse food, and occasional parasites, what a change! The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
    probability is that a stranger would pass the comfortable-looking
    house, with its creepers over the porch, its well-stocked garden,
    English home life, and generally inviting appearance. The geniality and
    kindly welcome offered by the master of the house are most delightful,
    and every one who visits it has a strong wish to rest for awhile in
    such agreeable quarters. The valley is very bold and grand, and good
    expeditions can be made in all directions. The Paymaster-general,
    with honest pride, pointed out to us where, on a former visit, he had
    killed a fine fish, and seemed to realise the fact that, having once
    experienced that gratification, you can go on killing the same fish,
    with all its pleasant associations, for the rest of your life. But we
    soon had to leave this inviting spot for rougher quarters, being bound
    due north, to be up for August 1st and reindeer; and as time, tide,
    and August 1st wait for no man, we started for our next station&mdash;Nedre
    Vasenden, on the Jolster Vand.</p>

  <p>On arriving there no luxuriant garden growth welcomed us. Instead of a
    south aspect, it was a north one. The atmosphere was changed, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>we
    missed our beloved Sande. As it was Saturday night, we looked forward
    to a quiet Sunday, with church, the meeting of the peasants, and a
    good chance of seeing all the costumes of the district, which is wild,
    barren, and uncultivated. The Sunday morning was inviting, and we took
    the opportunity of going to the lake, at a retired spot where the
    mountain path came down to the water’s edge, for a quiet bathe; but no
    sooner were we in the water than a troop of peasant girls came slowly
    down the path. Confusion and dismay! Norwegians do not understand our
    amphibious tendencies. However, No. 1, with his characteristic retiring
    disposition, dived, leaving a certain disturbance of the water after
    his plunge, which attracted attention. Beyond this, only the smallest
    possible part of two heads might be seen. Now came the anxiety of
    wondering what the spectators would do. Would they throw stones at us,
    to make us run, or examine the contents of the chief’s pockets, or try
    on some of our garments? No; while wishing we had the epidermis of a
    Captain Webb the whole group suddenly laughed, and moved slowly off,
    evidently thinking how curious the English were in their habits. We
    afterwards met at the church porch.</p>

    traveller taking to pony travelling in Norway
    implicitly believes that there is no danger of the animal ever falling;
    and it is a happy and comfortable faith. The <i>blakken</i> are rare good
    animals, cream-coloured, with dark points; hog manes like hat-brushes,
    with white down the centre, the black being outside; and their hind
    legs rather zebra marked. From the first they are petted, and their
    intelligence and stolid kindliness requite the care of the owners. They
    trot well; and how they can go down a hill! As they crouch and run
    close to the ground they need never be handed: no “’ands” required, as
    the British groom would describe it. Still, exception proves the rule,
    and we met with an instance in this <i>stolkjær</i> trip.</p>

  <p>We were going over the crest of a grand mountain road, below us <span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>a
    large lake, and beyond a glorious range of mountains. The deep tone of
    the fir forest added solemnity to the scene, and our good health and
    enjoyment of such company made it a happy moment. The Paymaster-general
    was leading&mdash;driving fast, as was his wont; for his driving was like
    the driving of Jehu. The Tentmaster-general was next, with a huge
    Norwegian sitting by his side. In a second came the transformation
    scene&mdash;nothing visible to the Patriarchal eye but the soles of the
    boots of the two persons in the <i>stolkjær</i>, the expanse of the huge
    Norwegian foot forming a contrast to the small neat extremity of the
    Tentmaster, who was shot out with great velocity, and stunned by his
    unavoidable concussion with the earth. We laid him in the heather by
    the side of the road, anxious for his recovery. Happily he soon came
    round, but was much shaken; it was, therefore, necessary to proceed
    very gently to avoid further shaking, and we purposed halting for a day
    or two, until we could get the advice of a doctor. It assumes the form
    of real travel when doctors are two days distant or more, and you carry
    your own lint and medicine. Thankful were we to see the return of the
    old smile on the Tentmaster’s face, and to hear from his own lips the
    welcome bulletin, “I am better.” The pony was not hurt, while the big
    Norwegian had a <i>skaal</i> of whiskey, and, we fancied, was ready to be
    thrown out again to obtain a second remedy. Soon afterwards we arrived
    at Jolster Vand by Nedre Vasenden.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>Norwegian Plough.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>The station here is a huge&mdash;may we say dreary&mdash;wooden house. The
    next morning, however, brought its joys and happy combination of
    circumstances: the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>invalid was much better, the bright July morning
    perfect; there was service at the annex kirk along the <i>vand</i>, or
    lake; and we purposed going by boat with some peasants, and a most
    enjoyable row it was. As we neared the church we found many boats
    already arrived, and, invited by the loveliness of the morning, the
    beauties of Jolster had congregated and were looking their best. Many
    <i>stolkjærs</i> were standing round the walls of the churchyard, and the
    ponies were enjoying themselves, nibbling the short grass as far round
    as their tether would allow them. There were some quaint costumes.
    These good church-going peasantry arrive early; and, as many dwell so
    far apart, and seldom meet except on these occasions or on some special
    business, we cannot be surprised to find that, instead of opening the
    meeting with prayer, the practice on the part of the men is to indulge
    in a little worldly talk before church, while the girls, according to
    custom, complete their toilettes from the contents of their <i>tines</i>,
    or travelling boxes, the said contents being a mixture of old silver
    brooches, silk handkerchiefs, and <i>fladbrod</i>: in some cases the butter
    is carried separately in a small <i>tine</i>. One incident struck us very
    forcibly&mdash;the kindly interest the girls took in the neatness and finish
    of each other’s dress. Only fancy three nice-looking <i>piger</i>, or girls,
    sitting one behind the other, each plaiting the hair of the girl in
    front of her. What absence of mystery as to capillary arrangements!
    No “Lady Audley’s Secret” (which <cite>Punch</cite> said was her back hair). No;
    each girl wished her friend to look her best, and carefully adjusted a
    string here or a brooch elsewhere, for there were no looking-glasses
    about. Then there were several other objects of interest. The black
    caps of the Jolster women are very curious, with a little white showing
    all round the edge. The covering up or hiding of the hair has a very
    mediæval appearance, but the nice little stand-up collars give a more
    modern character to the neck. The plaiting of their homespun dresses is
    very close indeed.</p>

  </div>

  <p>On this occasion there were two or three knots of people, suggestive of
    something of unusual interest; and we found the centre of each to be a
    little baby brought to be christened, surrounded by admiring relatives.
    Such babies! such funny little chrysalis-looking pets, swaddled
    and rolled up! the swaddling-bands being of many colours, the more
    brilliant <span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>the better&mdash;red, white, green, and crimson&mdash;with the cross
    frequently introduced, and generally so worked as to come uppermost in
    the band. The swaddling process seems much the same as in Brittany,
    where a ring is sometimes fastened at the back by which to hang the
    child up while the mother goes to work. No one could have seen this
    peaceful Sunday morning without being struck with the beautifully clean
    appearance of every one there&mdash;the homespun (<i>vadmel</i>) looked so sound,
    and so likely to wear well; the old silver ornaments so respectable
    and heirloomy. Of course on week-days, when the women are seen in the
    roughest of their outdoor life, it would be unreasonable to expect to
    find them as neat and prim as on Sunday. What a contrast, too, did this
    glorious sunshine and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>joyous meeting present to the bleak dark days
    of winter, when perhaps a hundred and fifty pairs of snow shoes, eight
    feet long, are set up round the church, waiting their owners’ bidding
    to start <em>home</em>!</p>

  </div>

  <p>After this cheerful interlude we went on to the next station&mdash;if
    such it could be called. We intended making a meal there, and rather
    looked forward to it; but nothing, not a single thing, could be had.
    We therefore made a fire, and into a black pot put some portable soup,
    with slices of Brand’s gravy-looking biscuits. Whilst the Tentmaster
    tried to do the soup the Patriarch in vain sought a wooden spoon;
    not even that was to be got; so the soup was stirred and tasted with
    a birch twig. But he made a discovery: whilst spoon-hunting in a
    drawer, which would only partly open, he saw the end of a mutton bone;
    perseverance was rewarded, the drawer was opened; but the result worse
    than a blank, for the shoulder-blade bone of mutton was bare, save the
    green fluffy mould in which it was mantled. Some people may say, “Not
    so bad; soup and biscuit, biscuit and soup, is a change.” Still, in
    long journeys with <i>stolkjærs</i> over rough ground, you can form no idea
    how shaky and restless it becomes. Moral: always carry a spoon, and,
    above all things, never start anywhere without a nosebag with plenty in
    it.</p>

  <p>This Nordfjord district is one of special interest now, as recent
    discoveries have corroborated the old traditions of its close
    association with the Viking period&mdash;a period bearing so powerfully
    on our own national character, that the subject should be fully
    investigated, and the extant remains of the Sea Kings’ real life
    placed carefully before us. For the nonce it will suffice to refer to
    one particular tumulus, recently discovered and opened in Nordfjord.
    As Denmark rejoices in, and is much indebted to, the archæological
    enthusiasm, deep research, and sound knowledge of Professor Worsaae, so
    Norway is fortunate in having the devotion of M. Lorange, who not only
    tries to lay these precious earthbound relics before us, but actually
    rescues them for our benefit and that of posterity; not only interests
    the dry antiquarian and connoisseur, but in a far larger way draws more
    closely together the bonds of union and interest between nations. It
    is remarkable that a Roman emperor was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>the means of developing the
    sea powers of the Scandinavians rather than they themselves; for only
    recently some interesting coins of Marcus Aurelius have been found in a
    tumulus in Denmark.</p>

  <p>The contents of the Nordfjord tumulus were as follows:&mdash;Boat with
    iron rivets twenty-five mètres long; a bit; fifty-four bosses of
    shields, or umbos; stirrup; a drinking bowl of immense interest, and
    well enamelled; sword, with silver work; key of treasure chest, spear
    head, bone comb inlaid with colour, gold ring, dice, arrows, deck
    marbles, beads and amulets, bones of horse and kid, belt of bronze, and
    belt-knife.</p>

  <p>Having heard what tradition says about the funeral rites of the
    great ones, the contents of this tumulus, as well as the numismatic
    discoveries in Denmark, are especially interesting, as corroborative
    of history. We are much indebted to pagan customs and rites for the
    valuable materials brought to light in connection with this period.
    With Odin for their Mars, or god of war, and Thor for their god of
    air and storm, they believed that their mighty men and heroes would
    pass to Walhalla, and there enjoy the future in the same way, but
    more perfectly, that they enjoyed themselves here upon earth&mdash;strong
    symptoms of their belief in the resurrection of the body. For this
    purpose they buried with the defunct all his implements of war and
    chase; the horse was killed and placed in readiness, and, should he be
    pleased to row, his boat was there too. In the Nordfjord case the bowl
    is especially fine. Notice the delicate work in the base of it: in the
    woodcut the upper subject is the bottom of the bowl. The enamel is very
    minute; the “chequer” design, one might say, very Scotch. The enamel is
    only on the base of the bowl; the body is of bronze, and the upper rim
    is ornamented by three heads, one of which is shown in the centre of
    the illustration. This is drawn full size, and the base of the bowl one
    quarter size.</p>

  <p>The two buttons are of single wire, very rudely but cleverly arranged,
    with shanks not likely to be pulled away from the body. These are of
    gold.</p>

  <p>The key of the treasure chest would suggest that many good things had
    been stored therein. Still the list is so complete that we could hardly
    expect more items than those recorded.</p>

  <p>The ivory or bone comb is a fine specimen, and the coloured work well
    preserved.</p>

  <p>The dice also are rather curious, as being a little longer than quite
    square.</p>

  <p>One of the most remarkable features, however, in the contents of this
    tumulus is a set of bone marbles about one inch in diameter. The sphere
    or marble is flat at the bottom, and has a small hole in it. These
    marbles were used by men who spent their lives in ships, and were
    played with on deck, the flat base being intended to keep them steady,
    while the holes at the bottom, fitting on to small pegs in the deck or
    board, prevented them from sliding as the vessel lurched. There was a
    most interesting discussion on this matter at the Society of Arts. Deck
    marbles were a novelty. Professor Bryce suggested that deck draughts
    would be a solution of the difficulty; and after referring to the
    antiquity of the game of draughts and the modes of playing, Professor
    Maguierson gave a dissertation on the ancient game of “merelles,” known
    in Iceland and Scandinavia as “mylla;” and even in the present day
    the shepherds and boys on our South Downs cut the same pattern in the
    close turf, and play the same game. We therefore come to the conclusion
    that these bone treasures had been used on board the vessels of the
    mighty Sea Kings of old, the little pegs, as just observed, preventing
    their slipping, and also the hero from losing his temper and using
    “pure Saxon.” The same precaution is in these days applied to railway
    chessmen, and also those intended for use on shipboard, each figure
    having its peg for safety and security. “Nothing new under the sun,”
    said the wise man, and true is it.</p>

  <p>Eleven o’clock at night, four thousand feet above the sea, we find
    ourselves at the top of the pass, just above Udvig, looking over
    Nordfjord. After a long day, and a very hard one, pleasantly tired,
    we enjoy the scene before us: peace and tranquillity, with snow poles
    all along to suggest what winter made it. The happy moment has arrived
    to commence the descent. “Half the pleasure is in the anticipation,”
    has often been remarked: we all thought this about half-way down
    this <span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>precipitous descent in the twilight. The torrent path seemed
    filled with boulders, the ponies slid, the bipeds stumbled, and by the
    time we were half-way down we had no knees left. This is one of the
    roughest ascents and descents in Norway, and is hardly practicable for
    any kind of carriage: still it is one of the things to be done, and
    one of the charms of the country. Lazy people lose much of the grand
    scenery with which it abounds. Steady going tells best, and those who
    try to spurt early in the day are much the worse for it afterwards.
    How steadily an old Swiss guide starts off, and keeps at his pace, on
    and on! That is the only way to last. By this time we see a flickering
    light down below: we long for it, and soon arrive, but very late&mdash;about
    one o’clock <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> We knock at the door of the station, which
    is really a private house, like that at Aurjhem, but selected by the
    Government to facilitate the wanderings of travellers. We are therefore
    the more indebted for the kind welcome we receive. Down comes the young
    son Jules, who immediately recognises our Tentmaster-general. Soon we
    have some refreshment; and not long afterwards Master Jules says, “Jeg
    schal go seng” (“I shall go to bed”). So said all of us&mdash;and we went.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the morning we were up early. A bathe in the fjord was our first
    thought, although the big stones are much against it, and the seaweed
    spoils it: the only way is to take a header out of the boat. After
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>breakfast we espied a novelty in water travel: a large birch bough
    was seen approaching, which we soon discerned to be the postman
    availing himself of a fair wind after the usual custom here, a sail
    being too dangerous even with sheet in hand. The original and simple
    practice of cutting a large birch bough, and putting it in the bow of
    the boat, serves the purpose better, the fresh foliage holding the
    light air, and helping very materially the rower, who is frequently,
    as in the present case, of the gentler sex, but very strong. The
    postman sits complacently in the stern of the boat, with his bugle
    just announcing his arrival, and rousing up the inhabitants of the
    quiet village of Udvig. The bag is not large, but most important in
    appearance&mdash;a huge leathern mass, locked, barred, and bolted. The boat
    speedily comes to land, and the well-known sound and scrape are heard.
    The bag is soon out, and the postman also: the post has arrived at Udvig.</p>

  <p>We rowed out on the fjord to look up at the pass we had come down so
    early in the morning; the view was very grand, backed by the higher
    ranges of the Justedal snow. We had next to visit one spot which seemed
    a great favourite with the host and hostess, and therefore started off,
    and soon reached a position, having followed a strong stream or burn
    which came above a saw-mill, looking over which the whole fjord lay at
    our feet, the mountains on the other side looming stupendously.</p>

  <p>Returning, we visited the church and lych gate (see <a href="#Page_82">p. 82</a>), the latter
    narrower and higher than usual. When we regained our station a new
    phase of life awaited and burst upon us. An invitation to a dance!
    It <span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>was somebody’s birthday&mdash;the nineteenth&mdash;a young visitor from
    Stockholm. Would we join in the festivities? We were delighted to have
    the opportunity of visiting a family on such an occasion; but the
    dancing element alarmed us when we thought of our rough boots and our
    walk down, we being rather particular, and knowing what boots should
    be. What was to be done? We shall see.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the meantime two boats were watched with much interest: one
    contained the domine and family, the other some well-to-do friends. The
    hearty welcome they received was beautiful; their sweet simplicity and
    genuine affection were charming, and certainly will never be forgotten
    by us, their visitors. Soon after the arrival the repast or dinner
    was announced, and the real Norwegian customs were well placed before
    us.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span> After one course the master and lady of the house waited on us,
    every guest getting a knife and fork; and at the end of each we went
    and shook hands with the host and hostess, the children kissing their
    parents.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> After the fish and various solids we adjourned to another
    room for fruit, <i>patisserie</i>, coffee, and, not an unwise thing in
    Norway, a cigar. The next event was to adjourn to the garden to see a
    glorious sunset over the fjord, and to finish the cigar. During this
    agreeable part of the evening the youthful Jules, with his nice fair
    face, came and asked if the “English gentlemen would come and play
    with the girls in the garden.” The Patriarch of our party sent his two
    young bachelor companions, who <span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>readily accepted the invitation with
    a spontaneous “Oh jag!” Report says the amusements in the garden were
    a combination of hide-and-seek, Tom Tiddler’s ground, and prisoner’s
    base. Anyhow they all seemed to have enjoyed them; in fact, the
    Patriarch often regretted afterwards he did not join the youthful
    throng instead of remaining with the seniors. Still there was much
    festivity in store, and the Patriarch took kindly to the dance, which
    included schottisches, mazourkas, and valses. This brings us to the
    boot question. The dance commenced. The evening began merrily. The
    piano (for there was a piano, and a good one, from Christiania) was in
    tune, and all were thoroughly enjoying themselves, when attention was
    drawn to one dancer in particular. Sage as an owl, how silently this
    youthful Achilles glided! How softly yet firmly he trod the polished
    boards, for no juniper tips were scattered that evening on the floor!
    Why was it? The Paymaster-general, equal to the occasion, was dancing
    in goloshes! O shades of Scandinavian gods! O Thor and Odin! that this
    should be the result of civilisation in Kjære Gamle Norge!</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a>This has been referred to in former books, we are well
      aware, but could we omit a custom so expressive of gratitude? <i>Le bon
      Dieu donne tout</i>; but do we always give thanks?</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>The Olden River.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>Another great feature in the evening was the singing and the national
    music&mdash;and how we did enjoy it! Need we say how they sang, and we tried
    to sing, “The Hardanger,” by H. Kjerulf, and the chorus song of “Norsk
    Sjømandssang,” by Grieg, which goes with such grand emphasis; and the
    light tripping sweetness of “Ingrids Vise,” also by Kjerulf, with its
    chorus of “Over Lynget, over Lynget?”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Another, specially bright and
    cheery, touched the Patriarch very deeply; he is often heard still
    humming this air “without words,” which the merry dancer described as
    being all about some beautiful creature with large blue eyes and golden
    hair. If she had but been with us to have danced with the goloshes,
    what would she have thought?</p>

  <p>It was a delightful opportunity for us to see the <i>vie intime</i> of a
    nice family in Norway. The welcome was most cordial; and thankful were
    we to find ourselves unexpectedly in a spot which every one tried to
    make us feel to be our home. Long may Herr Hammer, Madame Hammer, and
    their kindly family enjoy health and prosperity! and, might we say,
    continue their kindness and attention to those who go to Udvig?&mdash;for it
    seems a perfect pleasure to them to do so.</p>

  <div class="figright illow50" id="i_091">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_091.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>Lyth Fishing.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>There was a disinclination to hurry from Udvig in spite of the
    fine trip before us, for it is a lovely row up the Nordfjord. The
    Tentmaster-general seemed loath to leave, he was so pleased with Jules;
    he thought he had grown&mdash;had so improved; and he determined on several
    good openings for him in London. The Paymaster-general had evidently
    made a great impression, and no wonder, with the happy combination
    of youth, a petite, petted dark moustache, and enthusiastic forehead
    and goloshes, to say nothing of really good firework execution on the
    Christiania piano. We were horrified afterwards to find that all this
    had induced the young ladies to ask him to write all our names on a
    pane of glass. In a weak moment he yielded; but why did he? How often
    have complaints been made by ourselves of the creatures who carved and
    wrote names! There were, perhaps, extenuating circumstances in this
    case. So farewell to Udvig and its pleasant associations.</p>

  <p>And now for a start up the Nordfjord to Faleidet. Such a good boat was
    supplied by Herr Hammer! How we enjoyed it, looking forward to our
    drive from Faleidet! We soon came upon a number of boats fishing for
    <i>lyth</i>, a fish caught in large numbers, easily taken, readily consumed:
    there were a great many boats, and they fish with a deep-sea single
    line, feeling the bite over the forefinger, as in Scotland. We wanted
    much to have seen some of the red sea-fish taken, which are much larger
    than <span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>the mullet, but redder in tone and of splendid colour: a noble
    fish to look at when caught, but poor on table.</p>

  <p>Faleidet is a good station, beautifully clean, and well situated over
    the water. Here we were much interested in specimens of copper ore, on
    the richness of which our native held forth most fluently. The ore was
    decidedly good, and I think in his own mind the Tentmaster had promoted
    a company, and probably thought of the youthful Jules as assistant
    secretary and foreign correspondent. No time was to be lost, so we
    hastened to our <i>stolkjærs</i>, but hardly had we reached the top of the
    hill when the Patriarch’s gimlet eye saw a long birch horn near a shed
    by the roadside. This could not be resisted. “Halt!” was the word,
    whilst the others went on. They soon pulled up, for the too-tooing was
    noisy, if deficient in harmony; still there was a certain satisfaction
    in the fact that one had elicited sound from a long birch horn, as used
    by the good people of Faleidet, inferior as these horns are in force to
    steam fog-horns, as now used at the Foreland, or the steamboat whistle
    which skewers the tympanum of every traveller at every stopping place,
    be it where it may. There is a great charm in all these old-fashioned
    ways of doing things. Again the girls call to their cows, singing
    to them in very sweet strains, and the cows follow them. It is no
    question of a subtle tin-tack looking them up, which, like the county
    of Buckingham, runs into Oxon and Herts. The whole treatment of animals
    in Norway is a good example: the kindness is consistent and the care
    unceasing. The early training of the children has much to do with this;
    at all events the youthful impressions and the influence of the parents
    have never lost one iota of good.</p>

  <p>The Nordfjord is a great inlet of the sea which runs up an immense
    distance, and greatly favoured the Viking tendencies. Many fine remains
    have been discovered, and the contents of one tumulus in particular,
    now carefully preserved in the museum at Bergen, have been already laid
    before the reader.</p>

    the Nordfjord and passing through much that
    is grand, we start from Faleidet, and when we arrive at Haugen have a
    glorious view of the Horningdals Vand. Our hopes are buoyant, for it
    is a “fast” station; and our appetites are good. What natural beauty
    around us! To be happy, however, requires a combination that is seldom
    realised. In this case one thing was wanting, and to travellers such
    as ourselves it was a most important item&mdash;namely, food. The station
    was fair to view. On the stone steps young children were playing; and
    the numerous family were nursing each other&mdash;rollicking, chubby-faced,
    and unwashed: for Norwegian children they were merry. In the road in
    front of the house was standing a gaunt figure in knee-breeches and
    stockings; and, with his braces hauling on to the short waist, his
    long hair, and his straggling beard, he made a good type of what he
    really was&mdash;a slayer of bears. Above the entrance, over the merry group
    of children, were two bears’ skulls&mdash;the triumph, joy, and pride of
    the slayer. Being short of provisions, we soon went on a voyage of
    discovery, and investigated the interior; but what a blank it proved!
    The fast station folk knew nothing, or pretended to know nothing. “A
    cradle” of good carved wood, a bed in the corner of the room, and a
    fireplace seemed to be all in this homestead. The only <i>fladbrod</i> we
    could procure was of that unwelcome class prepared for travelling,
    which means that it is flabby and tough enough to be rolled up and
    folded without breaking. When the practical reader thinks of the
    shaking, jolting, convulsive jerking action of <i>stolkjærs</i>, and even
    carrioles, no wonder this food is left rather doughy for its journey.
    Happy the man who, when he meets with this material, can set it up on
    end! Dry it to the oat-cake condition, then it is good indeed&mdash;very
    good. Still we made the best of it, and came to the conclusion that one
    of the charms of travel is the variety of situation; and then, after
    all, with pleasant companions, anything short of bad accidents is only
    the kind of thing which the true traveller must expect, and almost
    seeks. So we looked <span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>forward to the next good meal we could get, but
    which must be very late in the day.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>Haugen, near Hellesylt.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>Some one suggested the advisability of smoking down our appetites. That
    was declined as injudicious, and we longed to reach Hellesylt. The
    second stage on, near Haugen, we saw a wonderful peak. Some idea of its
    towering grandeur may be formed by setting its printed name on end. It
    has no end of a name: here it is&mdash;Horningdalskrakken. What a pity one
    cannot have time to “do” all these peaks, this one especially, isolated
    as it is, and commanding a most interesting range, with so many fjords
    at its feet, and the Hjørrendfjord and its shriven peaks bristling
    below! In these days of express trains, fish torpedoes going twenty
    knots an hour, telegrams, and instantaneous photographs, people <span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>will
    not give sufficient time to do anything with steady enjoyment. Skurry
    and scuttle are too prominent by far.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow70" id="i_095">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_095.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>The Horningdalskrakken, near Haugen.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>As we approach Hellesylt the mountains become higher, more bluff,
    their formation more tortuous, and we anxiously begin to look out
    for our descent to the station&mdash;town one cannot call it; in fact,
    hardly a village. Arrived at the top of the pass, with the river
    dashing and splashing, the zigzag of the road is like patent cucumber
    scissors&mdash;twenty zigzags or more. At one’s feet lie the Storfjord, the
    Geiranger district, and Søndmur. Of course there is the usual church,
    most prominently posted, with a good station, to welcome those who
    escape from Haugen’s natural grandeur to the stomachic comfort of
    Hellesylt. What a good meal we all thought supper was that night! It
    was not the mere pleasure of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>going in for a meal, but we had felt the
    want of it, and now were thankful to enjoy thoroughly the good cheer
    before us. There are very few parts of Norway which exceed the grandeur
    of the neighbourhood of this place. The Storfjord is immensely grand,
    but the Geiranger is a climax. The steamer from Hellesylt to Aalesund
    goes down the Storfjord, affording a great variety of scenery, with
    considerable comfort to passengers, as the vessels are well served; and
    in this case the steamer has a captain known to all who have travelled
    here, and always remembered with the most pleasing associations.
    Captain Dahl has done much for this district, and has opened up the
    unparalleled Geiranger fjord. Are not his good qualities recognised and
    noticed throughout Norway by ladies? Having said so much, we hope to
    visit Geiranger again under the captain’s kind care.</p>

  <p>At Hellesylt we all noticed a prevalence of brass-mounted belts among
    the men. Norwegian belts have invaded England and taken it by storm,
    from the luxurious productions of a Thornhill, regardless of price,
    to the other extreme, the Birmingham wholesale harum-scarum article,
    which loses its gloss in a few hours. The Norwegian belt is a national
    characteristic, adopted by both sexes, being worn on all occasions and
    for various purposes. An instance occurred when two were used during a
    trip to keep on a linseed poultice; but this was a modern innovation.</p>

  <p>We were up early indeed the morning after arrival at Hellesylt. What a
    morning! Hardly a breath as the steamer lay at the little pier waiting
    for us. We had arranged with Captain Dahl to go up the Geiranger as
    far as Maraak, so as to pass the glorious fall of the “Seven Sisters,”
    and see it in all its beauty. We were very fortunate in all the
    circumstances connected with this visit&mdash;weather fine, scenery grand,
    cicerone full of enthusiasm and information, companions reliable,
    food, after Haugen, one may say “good, plentiful and good.” The
    characteristic features of this Geiranger, which has only been known
    to travellers during the last few years, are the extremely precipitous
    façade of rocks that enclose it, the paucity of landing places, and its
    beautiful fall, the Seven Sisters. We arrived at the foot of it about
    six o’clock <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and, as the sun was well to the eastward,
    the effect was fairylike&mdash;the prismatic <span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>rays seemed to pervade
    the base of the fall. The Seven Sisters come over and take their first
    flight some two thousand feet above the fjord, and the streams, seven
    in number, according to the pressure of melted snow above, combine and
    separate, lose themselves in spray and spoondrift, and then collect
    again from the dripping face of the rock, and finally the whole base
    is “gauzed,” so to speak, with the dash of mist and the prismatic rays
    called by sailors “blossoms”&mdash;really portions of rainbows. We wanted
    to linger over the beauty of this spot&mdash;such delicacy of form, as the
    streams shot forth some of the rocket jets, losing themselves for a
    time, and then collecting with renewed energy for the final dash into
    the fjord; but at last even Captain Dahl goes ahead, and we steam on
    for Maraak, at the end of the fjord. Opposite to the falls we see a
    relic of old Scandinavian paganism. Jutting from steep rocks, of two
    thousand or three thousand feet, above a solitary boathouse, is shown
    a prominent rock, called the “Pulpit,” and above that the gigantic
    profile of a Viking; while higher still are situated some farms,
    well away from modern improvements. If any one dies there during the
    winter the inhabitants keep the body until the snow is sufficiently
    melted to allow of its being brought down for conveyance to Hellesylt.
    It is their custom also to tether their children, for the “go-cart”
    conveyance of the seventeenth century, as shown in Quarles’s “Emblems,”
    would soon be over the edge, urging its wild career to the depths
    below. The very thought of such a position would be enough to frighten
    some people; but how happy in themselves are these poor folks in their
    simple belief and faith, their home love and trust! How difficult is
    it to consider this kind of happiness, when the same family goes on in
    the same position in life for three or four hundred years, in the same
    costume, and with the same old silver ornaments! “How bad for trade!”
    some would say. “What stagnation! how slow!” Yet how <span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>enviable when we
    have tasted the bitters of overstrained brain-work, and the furious
    competition of millions of people, all massed and arrayed for the daily
    struggle of modern times! It is from this latter that men retire for
    awhile to take a refresher, a change of air and circumstance becoming a
    matter of necessity; and so London, after a season of gaiety and rush,
    is left in favour of outlandish places, simple fare, and, in fact, to
    get away from the daily jostle of life, to be ready for the next bout.</p>

  <p>After our return from Maraak, Captain Dahl continued his passage
    towards Aalesund. The Geiranger features were less marked until we
    arrived at an immense perpendicular surface of rock, evidently but
    recently exposed to view; and its appearance is explained by the fact
    that some years ago the whole facing of this mountain came bodily down
    into the fjord, raising an immense wave which swept across the expanse
    of water, and almost entirely destroyed the village on the opposite
    side. A more recent case occurred in the Nordfjord. The Hornelen
    Mountain rises majestically from the fjord, going down from Bryggen.
    Out of compliment to this monarch and giant a new steamer was named
    after it; and, on the first occasion of passing, the captain honoured
    Hornelen with a salvo, which was promptly answered by a great mass of
    rock being launched from the mountain side, throwing up a wave which
    nearly annihilated the saluters, and frightened some of them so much
    that they will never venture to repeat their <i>feu de joie</i>. It is
    equally dangerous to disturb or cause any considerable vibration in the
    atmosphere under glacial ice or snowdrift: many lives have been lost in
    this way, and the fact cannot be too strenuously impressed on the minds
    of all travellers.</p>

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img illow25"><img src="images/i_101.jpg" alt="T" /></span>O
    those going northward Molde has especial interest for many reasons:
    its situation is beautiful, its climate delightful, its vegetation
    luxuriant, its flora abundant, and, as a centre to radiate from, it
    is most convenient. To arrive there one becomes associated <i>pro tem.</i>
    with the good ship <i>Tasso</i>. “Good ship” is used, in this instance, as
    a term of affection among old Norwegians. In former days it was rarely
    that any save real sportsmen or regular fishers were to be found on
    board. Every one was known. The steward knew every one by name; the
    captain looked forward to seeing his “regulars,” and could tell exactly
    how much he would see of each individual passenger. Judging from the
    weather, he could guess the number for each festive meal in the saloon,
    and knew without a doubt who would propose to smoke a cigar on deck, or
    one more pipe before turning in, and who would be ready to spin a good
    yarn if there were any chance of conversation flagging. From Hull to
    Trondhjem a fraternity existed, on condition that no one betrayed undue
    curiosity about his fellow-traveller’s river. That condition carried
    out, any one might kill his fish over and over <span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>again, and even add a
    pound or two, rather than the relater should not be happy. The captain
    of the <i>Tasso</i> was decidedly a favourite, and could the weather at all
    times have proved as fair as the captain himself, the <i>Tasso</i> would
    have been always crowded with passengers; for even in spite of the
    stormy winds of the North Sea there has been such a thing as a telegram
    for the captain, hoping he would wait for the next train, as &mdash;&mdash;
    wanted to go by the <i>Tasso</i>. There is much sentiment about this dear
    old vessel. Light as a cork, in a breeze she can throw you up off your
    legs, and catch you somehow when you come down. She is lively, but that
    is better than being driven through everything, tunnelling the long
    seas. Besides, if the Saturday be very bad, and Saturday night too,
    Sunday afternoon generally improves matters, and by the evening some
    ladies venture up in the captain-cabin on deck for a little fresh air,
    and are well looked after; for the captain himself, in spite of having
    been up all night, comes out with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>his personal appearance unimpaired,
    and buttoning his gloves, which he wears only on Sundays. He had a
    very impressive way of buttoning the right glove, as if a great work
    had just been completed, and the mere act would revive the passengers.
    Still he was a thorough sailor and a great favourite, and everybody
    regrets that he no longer commands the <i>Tasso</i>.</p>

  <p>This vessel, which leaves Hull on Friday night, with her course
    north-east, ploughs, or rather bruises, the North Sea until
    Monday morning, when the first land is made, which is generally
    Statland&mdash;bluff, wild, precipitous, and if not almost uninhabited,
    at all events very sparsely populated. Having made this point, the
    <i>Tasso</i>, altering her course, runs up the coast for Aalesund, before
    reaching which the number of passengers on deck increases. Passengers
    are always divided into two classes&mdash;the well and the unwell, or
    “marines.” It is surprising how strongly the marines muster at this
    point, and discover that they would have come up before <span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>if they had
    known there was anything really worth getting up for. Not a syllable
    do they utter about how they envied those humble people who were
    always asking for more roast beef, and who relished bottled stout.
    Neptune’s habit of rocking stops many a hearty meal, and keeps many a
    visitor from Norway, levelling even the great and mighty; for even the
    president of a learned society has been seen lying on the deck, rolled
    up in a blanket, with the large red letters “Scandinavia” across his
    vertebræ, helpless and mute, though his object in coming was to talk
    Norske; but the sea god denied him the luxury until he arrived at the
    land of Thor and Odin. Aalesund will be described afterwards.</p>

  <p>The <i>Tasso</i> arrives at Molde on Monday afternoon or evening, according
    to the run. If it is a fine evening, what a lovely sight after the
    permanent unbroken horizon of the last three days! On the left lies
    Molde; on the right, mountains, snow ranges, islands, and fjord
    entrances running up to Veblungsnæs, Alfernæs, and Eikesdal. Some have
    described <span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>Molde as a Naples; but the two places are as different as
    is Stockholm&mdash;sometimes called the Venice of the North&mdash;from Venice
    itself. Let each have praise for its individual beauty and grandeur,
    but no comparison can well be made.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>The Flower Market: Molde.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>The <i>Tasso</i> does not come alongside; the small coasting steamers do.
    Boats, therefore, come out, when one soon sees what seamen these
    Norsemen are; and the women are as good as the men. The principal
    figure as well as the voice most distinctly heard is that of Jacob, the
    polyglot and ubiquitous porter from the hotel. Molde was once famous
    for an hotel kept by Herr Buck and family, whose kindly reception and
    unceasing attention were a pleasure to the visitor. In front of the
    house were honeysuckles, clustering roses, geraniums&mdash;not yet called
    pelargoniums at Molde&mdash;wallflowers, fuchsias, and almost every kind
    of flower. With such <span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>good quarters, such attention, and such natural
    beauty, how could any one be disappointed in Molde? Yet so it was;
    one’s fancy was blighted by the footmark of civilisation&mdash;modern dress
    had supplanted costume. The <i>taille de Paris</i> was attempted, although
    it has not, up to this time, much reduced the general solidity of the
    Scandinavian waist. The heads of the people are much more transformed,
    and soon become smiling victims to the first phases of the vile taste
    for artificial flowers, feathers, and tawdry finery. If they only knew
    the dignity of simplicity and the charm of good silver ornaments handed
    down for generations, they would never so debase themselves.</p>

    <img class="w100" src="images/i_106.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>The Churchyard: Molde.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>Molde is almost entirely built of wooden houses painted white. In
    the lower basement the storehouses run out over the water for some
    distance, being built on most picturesque piles of timber, with solid
    galleries, affording delightful peeps seaward. This warm spot, nestling
    under the mountains, faces the south, and is naturally celebrated for
    the vigour of its vegetation and the luxuriance of every variety of
    floral growth, which is centred in the churchyard, where every Moldean
    tries to outvie his neighbour in the culture of fair flowers on the
    graves of those dear ones who have been called home. What a beautiful
    thought is this to keep before one through life&mdash;to be called home, and
    to look <span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>upon death as a friend, or as a schoolboy does upon his exit!
    Happy indeed are those who can do so! It has a soothing influence,
    which conduces to cheerfulness in old age; and what is cheerfulness in
    old age but a looming of the immortality of the soul, as the outer case
    begins to fade away?</p>

  <p>This lovely spot has been selected as the best locality for an
    establishment to solace the poor victims of that terrible scourge of
    the North&mdash;leprosy. White as a leper, and shining as Gehazi, Elijah’s
    servant&mdash;that is the aspect of Eastern leprosy. Not so in the North.
    The features of the Northern leper become purple and hard, and the
    feet swollen and fearfully disfigured. It is brought on by the absence
    of vegetable diet and the constant use of salt fish. The hospital is
    situated outside the town, on the south-west side, and is coloured
    yellow.</p>

  <p>Many routes start from Molde, and much character may be noticed
    on board the steamers&mdash;small practical craft, with very efficient
    captains&mdash;good seamen and remarkably obliging&mdash;a quality most
    acceptable to the traveller. But this attention is only accorded to
    those who adopt the axiom of the late Dr. Norman Macleod, who said the
    best language to travel with was, “Yes, if you please,” and “No, I
    thank you,” whether in domestic life or <i>en voyage</i>. It would conduce
    greatly to home harmony if this were more generally adopted. It is a
    wholesome contrast to a woodcut in <cite>Punch</cite> by that keen observer of
    human nature, John Leech, who portrayed a Transatlantic brother holding
    a revolver at the head of the person sitting next to him, adding only
    the simple words, “Pass the mustard.” To return, however, to the deck
    of the steamer.</p>

  <p>The lower class in Norway chew and expectorate; the upper class
    smoke, and some carry pipes. Carry is the correct term, for the pipe
    belongs to the class impedimenta. As the map of France is divided into
    departments, so may be the travelling pipe of Norway. First department,
    the mouthpiece; next, the elastic, to ease off the roll of steamer or
    jostle of stranger; then a huge silver tassel, generally two; then a
    stem and a joint; and finally the bowl of meerschaum. What an <i>écume de
    mer</i>! What a responsibility to travel with such an instrument! It is
    quite an apparatus&mdash;worse than a <i>narghile</i> or <i>chibouque</i>: less coil,
    but more tassel. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>bowl of the pipe is generally surmounted by a
    huge silver cover in the form of a crown. Our woodcut gives a specimen
    of one in the possession of an officer on a tour of inspection along
    the coast or fjord. As he is represented with his back to the land, it
    is only just to mention that there was some object of interest in front
    of him.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>The Coast Inspector.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>One more word for the <i>Tasso</i>. Returning from Trondhjem, she generally
    calls at Molde. Should bad weather come on, the waiting for twenty-four
    or forty-eight hours in constant expectation is wearying to a
    degree. One hardly dare patronise the good baths of Molde, admirably
    arranged as they are, so unmercifully do the jelly-fish sting; but
    the advantages of sea-bathing are irresistible, so, in spite of being
    stung, we indulge in a bath while waiting for the steamer, and in the
    midst of it we hear the alarming whistle of the <i>Tasso</i>. Rapid exit
    and hurry-skurry, in which tradition says the Tentmaster-general,
    anxious to be first, was last, from having tried to put on his flannel
    shirt without towelling sufficiently beforehand. Hurried as we were,
    there was still a ceremony to go through, which could not be omitted
    without giving offence. The bath attendant is most careful in his
    attention to visitors, who generally give him twopence. On receiving
    this honorarium he observes an old custom in Norway, that of shaking
    hands and thanking the donor; so we all kept up the good old charter,
    and received his kind wishes for our safe return to England and our
    homes. Unquestionably we carried with us delightful recollections of
    the kindness of the people, and especially of the <i>bönder</i> folk&mdash;many
    souvenirs to remind us of localities visited, and very deep impressions
    of the charm of their simple life, undisturbed, as it seemed, by those
    little envyings, strivings, emulations, and jealousies which, like
    mosquitoes, sting and irritate, to the misery of their unhappy victims.</p>

  <p>Surely the man who loves God, worships Him through nature, and traces
    his majesty in creation, would enjoy the spot depicted in the woodcut,
    where the village of Veblungsnæs is shown close to the edge of the
    fjord, backed by the snow range. What a neighbourhood to have round
    one! And what a contrast to the idea conveyed by the same word in
    modern acceptation! Here the sea-water of the fjord washes the edges of
    the hamlet, in many parts bluffly repelled by huge and mighty façades
    of rocks; there a ravine terminates in a waterfall into the sea itself.
    Valleys branch off in all directions, excursions are numerous, and many
    new ones still remain unexplored. The high fjeld is easy of access
    from Veblungsnæs, and real bear valleys are near, where Bruin exists
    and has met with his death at the hands of our countrymen. Natives
    have offered to go on the terms of “no bear, no pay.” This betokens
    an amount of practical confidence which is a prominent feature in all
    bargains between Scandinavians and our folk. Bruin is still a terror
    in some parts, and especially to the <i>sæter</i> people, or <i>piger</i>. For
    instance, near Isterdal the following circumstance occurred to a
    friend:&mdash;Scene, lonely <i>sæter</i>. English traveller approaching. <i>Pige</i>
    appears at window imploring help and beseeching traveller’s assistance.
    A bear has been down, and killed a cow. The <i>pige</i> positively dare
    not come out until the Englishman shoots the bear that killed the cow
    that frightened the <i>pige</i>. Now comes the sad finale. The dead cow
    could not be found, neither could the bear; and even had the latter
    been discovered, the traveller had no rifle to shoot him with. Still
    there can be no doubt of there being many yet left to be laid low by
    our enthusiastic fellow-hunters in days to come. Veblungsnæs is hardly
    appreciated by travellers, who are generally so bent on rushing forward
    to the well-known comforts of Aak, that they are blind to the beauty
    <i>en route</i>. Perhaps an innate longing to get away from villages makes
    them anxious to dive at once to the more placid and less populated
    parts. This place is generally reached by those who come from Molde
    by steamer, in which case the entrance to the Romsdal fjord is a
    grand subject, affording the most magnificent mountain and sea-scape
    combined. Happier far is the traveller who goes in a small sailing
    boat, with a good south-wester behind <span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>him, a tight sheet, and the
    water hissing away all round her, thrown off from her bows and rushing
    from her stern, as the crew lie down singing good Norske songs, some of
    which are as long as Gaelic ones; and that is saying a good deal.</p>

  <p>Veblungsnæs is close to the mouth of the Rauma, which rises in Lesje
    Vand, and after forcing its way through rocks and every kind of
    obstruction, finally finishes its course among peaceful sand plains.
    The village can boast of many good things. First, the church, or
    <i>kirke</i>, then the post-office, telegraph office, station for carrioles,
    a compulsory school, a baker of white bread, <i>præstegaard</i>, and a pier,
    to say nothing of the store or shop. Having made a bouquet of these
    charms, let us refer to them <i>seriatim</i>.</p>

  <p>The church is the old wooden structure from Gryten which was buried
    in the sand, and stood, as shown by the spire on the right hand side
    of the illustration, looking from Næss. It was moved about fifty
    years ago, and at that time was painted red, having only of late
    years assumed the more sombre hue which now characterizes its roof
    and spire&mdash;namely, black. The interior is plain fir; the pulpit is
    high up over the altar, and of a general light blue tone; while on
    the right side, on the ground, is the bishop’s stall, panelled up to
    the galleries, which go round the church. The candelabrum that hangs
    in the centre from the ceiling is very elegant in design, and made of
    pinchbeck; it is dated 1770. The silver candlesticks on the altar, one
    on each side, are large and massive; these are lighted three times a
    year&mdash;Christmas, Easter, and at the end of the forty days. The first
    priest appointed to Gryten commenced his work in 1514.</p>

  <p>Here we saw a funeral, which was largely attended, as the church is
    on a main road. The coffin was followed by seven <i>stolkjærs</i> and many
    people, some of whom had driven on before; but there was no clergyman
    to officiate.</p>

  <p>The post-office is kept in a very unofficial way. Calling one day, we
    found that the <i>post kontouress</i> (who, by the way, is a very superior
    person) was not at home, having left her official duties to assist
    at four o’clock tea&mdash;<i>société</i>. The postman is picturesque, with an
    enormous portmanteau,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> with irons, chains, and such fastenings, to
    assist in the protection of which he carries a horn and a revolver (see
    p. 87). He goes from this office to Dombaas, so that sometimes, from
    the difference of elevation, he will sledge one part regularly, and
    carriole the other. Before leaving the post-office we will thank the
    <i>chef</i> for all her kind attentions to us and many of our countrymen.</p>

  <p>The telegraph office is admirable. English spoken, and every
    information.</p>

  <p>The carriole station is at Herr Onsum’s, who seems to be the squire
    of Veblungsnæs. Here <i>tout est Onsum</i>&mdash;hotel, boats, land, and store.
    Every one has a good word for the member of the Storthing, Herr Onsum,
    and his musical and well-educated family.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow100" id="i_111">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_111.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>Carriole crossing a River.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>The school is, throughout Norway, for all denominations, and compulsory.</p>

  <p>As to the baker of white bread, this personage is mentioned because
    white-bread bakers are few and far between, and a valuable adjunct
    to Fiva, where we stopped. Twice a week “our daughter” drove in from
    Fiva to the baker at Veblungsnæs, about nine miles in and nine out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
    Sometimes the white bread was not ready, and after a nine-mile carriole
    drive, with a long ford across the river, it is rather trying to go
    back empty-handed. Occasionally there were additions, such as <i>rød
    fiske</i>, or red sea-fish, like very large mullet, hanging from the
    carriole, and picturesque in colour, to say nothing of odd baskets
    banging about. We must some time have a sketch of “The Return from
    Market through the Ford, with the Skyd-gut Boy behind.” Our daughter’s
    boy was rather an old one, Ole Fiva as he called himself&mdash;the <i>gamel
    skyd-gut</i>. The occasional one was very young, and very nice indeed:
    as he did not understand English, his answers resolved themselves
    almost always into the “blushing grin” of good-hearted innocence. At
    last “mee boy Matthias”&mdash;pronounced <i>Matteeus</i>&mdash;found an outlet for
    his feelings, and brought red berries, or <i>tyttebær</i> in his cap; and
    when he found them accepted, and that his offering gave us pleasure,
    he grinned and blushed more than ever. But why were we not sure of
    getting our white bread when we sent so far for it, hail, rain, or
    shine? For this reason. One day there was a glorious breeze out in the
    fjord, the white horses were showing their crests, while the gulls and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
    terns were sweeping round us. What a day for a sail! Herr Onsum had
    a good sea-boat, and would be sure to lend it to us if we asked. We
    did. My wife, daughter, self, Ole Fiva, with three Norwegians, full of
    sea-rovers’ expeditions and sagas, for a crew, were soon on board. As
    the craft was lying by the landing-place her bowsprit naturally rose up
    and down as the waves heaved her hull, when a voice came from the end
    of it: “Ole, Ole! Spørge, Ole, spørge!” Ole took no notice, and again
    came the same appeal from a figure with a white cap and jacket. It
    was the baker of the white bread, hanging on with a desperate effort,
    asking permission to go for a sail with us instead of getting our <i>vid
    brod</i> ready for us to take back. Judging from the uncertain movements
    of the applicant, it is to be feared the supply of white bread is
    equally precarious at Veblungsnæs.</p>

  <p>Our view of Næss is taken as looking up the Rauma River. On the left
    are the Vengetinderne, the Karlstrotind, and the Romsdal Horn over the
    valley, down which flows the river Rauma by Aak; the centre peak is the
    Mid-dag Horn; and on the right is the Isterdal valley, with the Biskop
    and Drönningen towering above. The little spire of Gryten is inserted
    here to show where it stood before its sand immersion and removal to
    its present resting-place. From this point one obtains a grand view and
    general idea of the immense sand and grit deposit collected here from
    the two valleys of the Rauma and Ister, the greater portion of which
    was ground off the sides of the valleys by the great glaciers when the
    glacial period was in full action, and before all the mighty ice giants
    melted at the presence of the new visitor to the coasts of Norway, the
    gulf stream. All down the valleys the rocks are worn and ground round
    by the <i>débris</i> in the ice as it passed down. Only some such phenomenon
    as that referred to could have so raised the temperature and worked
    such changes.</p>

  <p>On the following page an old friend is shown at work by the
    riverside&mdash;Ole Larsen, a shoemaker of simple habits and small
    <i>clientèle</i>, but very large family, about eighteen in number. Unlike
    many of our followers of St. Crispin, he begins <i>ab initio</i>, with
    the skin as removed from the animal, and is now getting the hair off
    previously to tanning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
    It can well be imagined that Ole Larsen does
    not do a large business in the course of the financial year, and the
    family seldom get meat, their whole nourishment being <i>brod og smör</i>,
    bunkers, and cow comforts.</p>

  <p>The Norwegian farm-building is called a <i>laave</i>, and is so constructed
    that the hay-carts can drive right in under cover, and be unladen at
    convenience: underneath are generally stables and a cow-house. Such a
    <i>laave</i> as the one shown on p. 116 will hold three ponies and about
    twelve cows. During the summer the cows all go up to the <i>sæter</i>, and
    about September return to the valleys, preparatory to their winter
    session, when, poor things, they are generally shut up from October
    right through the winter, till spring comes with all her brightness,
    and releases these long-pent prisoners from their thraldom. It is an
    amusing sight to see them first at liberty when the snow has melted
    in the valley. They gallop, kick, frisk, career, and chase each
    other; and the ponies join in the festivities with the cows and the
    goats, and rejoice together for a time, until all finally agree that
    there is nothing like good quiet steady grazing, to which they betake
    themselves.</p>

    seems centred all that is grand in nature, bold
    in outline, interesting in geological formation, with the constant
    registers of the ice passage down the valley, as it existed before the
    glacial period was melted away by the influence of the gulf stream.
    The whole valley suggests the idea of the crust of the earth having
    cracked in cooling, the fissures forming these immense valleys. At the
    entrance of the latter, as the river approaches the fjords or the sea,
    large plateaux of sand have been deposited in past ages, and through
    these sandhills the river forces its way, very frequently altering
    its course, until finally it reaches the sea. These sand plateaux or
    ridges are very distinctly shown at the entrance of the Rauma River, a
    little above Veblungsnæs, and being exposed to the winds through the
    two valleys&mdash;Romsdalen and Isterdalen&mdash;a change on the dry sand is
    perceptibly going on at all times. This is especially to be noticed
    at a spot called Gryten. In the maps it is marked as a church, and
    a church there once was in the position indicated; but, as we have
    already observed, it was so sanded up that it was taken to pieces and
    removed to Veblungsnæs away from the sand-storms, and just bordering on
    the fjord.</p>

  <p>The tourist of the promiscuous class is sure to rejoice in this part of
    Romsdal, as here is situated an old farmhouse, now adapted to modern
    customs, and purveying comforts of all kinds not generally found in
    Norway. A friend, visiting this happy spot some twenty years ago,
    was kindly received by the proprietor, Herr Landmark, who is still
    spared to conduce more than ever to the increasing wants of Norwegian
    travellers. By degrees the farmhouse has developed, and is now, with
    its new <i>annexe</i>, generally spoken of as the “Hotel at Aak.” Still,
    how different is it from the modern idea of such things! Very much of
    the leaven yet remains&mdash;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span> the same kindly reception, and the <i>likkelig
    reise</i> to the parting guest. Many ask regretfully as they leave the
    entrance of the house&mdash;in itself a picture: up four wooden steps to
    a stage with two small tables and seats&mdash;where such is to be found;
    others, perhaps just arrived, feast their eyes on the view over the
    Rauma towards the Drönningen and Biskop, in Isterdal; while others,
    again, anxiously watch for the first peep of the Romsdal Horn. Over the
    door and by the side clusters generally a glorious honeysuckle, which
    grows most profusely, and adds much to the picturesqueness. Inside, to
    the left, is the <i>salle à manger</i>, out of which leads a small room,
    which is, I believe, now generally left for any ladies stopping in
    the house. Not much monotony is there, but many delightful evenings,
    with a little music,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span> and sometimes an exceedingly good rendering of
    Mendelssohn, Schumann, Offenbach, or even the severe but sterling
    Beethoven.</p>

  <p>One evening, after a very earnest attempt on the part of our coterie to
    sing some Norwegian songs by Kjerulf, it was discovered that amongst
    those listening outside was the brother of the composer, Professor
    Kjerulf, now of the Geological chair at Christiania. He expressed
    himself as being highly gratified with the English appreciation of
    his brother’s undoubted talent. All this musician’s work has great
    individuality and crispness, and his airs always “go” well. Hear his
    “Brudefærden.”</p>

  <p>The previous woodcut shows the north side of the house and
    farm-buildings. The <i>stabur</i>, or provision-house, is there, with the
    bell above. This bell is rung regularly for the farm labourers to come
    in, as they are always fed by the <i>bönder</i>, and the meals, though
    very simple, seem frequent. It was at this good hostelry that Lady Di
    Beauclerc stopped and described the French count who was in search of
    good “chase” of reindeer there, and the lady whose pursuit was <i>le
    saumon</i>, and who had a fly of the same colour as her costume. One
    becomes imperceptibly very curiously impressed by an association of
    ideas. Several people have mentioned that they felt rather surprised
    that they had never seen the count with his French hunting horn, nor
    the lady. There is still an idea that their ghosts linger about the
    spot, waiting, we suppose, for the reindeer and the salmon to come to
    them. The friend who was so kindly received here some twenty years ago
    was offered a little fishing by Herr Landmark. A portion of the river
    Rauma runs in front under the house, and the good sport made the happy
    fisherman rabid for life on salmon: he has been to Norway almost every
    year since, and taken many with him.</p>

  <p>A few miles above Aak, leaving the sand plateau behind, we enter the
    Romsdal valley proper, with the Romsdal Horn rearing its grand peak
    on the left. The Troltinderne, or the Witches, is one of the most
    remarkable groups of fantastically jagged rocks in Norway, ever varying
    in effect, the mist wreathing and most delicately veiling or throwing
    a film over them, which makes them more gigantic and weird than ever.
    The outline of the peaks when clear is very serrated indeed, and with
    the Northern people a fair share of superstition attaches to them.
    These two elements have brought about the tradition that the series of
    <i>aiguilles</i> represent a wedding party going to the church. First, the
    <i>spilleman</i> (fiddler), then the <i>kanderman</i> (best man) with a tankard;
    the next large peak is the priest; then come two peaks, turning away as
    it were one from another: these were the unhappy bride and bridegroom,
    who foolishly and injudiciously quarrelled. Next come the father and
    mother. But the most curious character yet remains. By the side of a
    sharp point is a mass of rock, which certainly does look very much like
    a figure: this is the disconsolate lover, who, seeing that the bride<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
    and bridegroom had already quarrelled, makes a frantic rush to cut in
    and carry off the lady. This must have been the precise moment when
    they were all turned into stone, and so they remain, a warning to all
    frequenters of the valley. That the peasants believe in spirits and
    “little people” living on the fjeld, even in this year of grace, cannot
    be denied, as they say they do; but why they should think that these
    little people have blue heads I cannot imagine.</p>

    <img class="w100" src="images/i_120.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>Meal House: Fiva, Romsdal.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>Exactly opposite to the Romsdal Horn, on the other side of the valley,
    is an immense <i>couloir</i>, originally an enormous landslip, leaving the
    perpendicular sides of the Troltinderne to gradually crumble and fall
    down, the finer stuff and <i>débris</i> filling up the interstices between
    the bigger rocks. After frost the thunder of the falling rocks and
    stones into this terrific shoot will last as long as thirty seconds,
    and the nightfalls create constant alarm to new-corners; whereas the
    <i>elve-wakker</i>, or river-keeper, merely remarks, “The old ladies are
    quarrelling,” or “The old ladies have finished <i>aftenmad</i> and are
    throwing out the bones.” Still, this brings about a new range of
    thought to a person who has never observed portions <span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>of the earth’s
    surface in motion. After seeing a huge rock, the size of a stucco-faced
    villa, hop down the side of a mountain, there arise a certain
    impressiveness and grandeur unknown before. About once a year there is
    an important landslip in Norway&mdash;hardly more. Most of the loose rocks
    have their regular grooves, and the peasants know how to avoid them;
    still, as the vast country is so sparsely inhabited, many must occur
    which do not “get into the papers.” A curious instance of the effect
    of a small landslip occurred in this valley to an old man personally
    known to us. A slip came down behind his house, of good timber stuff,
    and fortunately stopped just short of it. He and his wife decided to
    leave, and go to live at a place called Aalesund; they did so for a
    twelvemonth, after which time they became home-sick, and, chancing
    all further damage, returned to the old house, where they were living
    very happily last year. In another part a description will be given
    of an important <i>steen-skreed</i>&mdash;a scene of terrible destruction and
    considerable interest.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>The Laave at Fiva: Romsdal.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>The centre of the valley has two or three good farms, highly productive
    for Norway, and presenting a very curious appearance to a foreigner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
    when the corn is cut, as the sheaves are stuck upon a pole, sometimes
    five, sometimes ten, with the head facing the sun, and, as the sun
    works round, the heads of corn are kept turned to it, so as to get the
    greatest amount of heat, which is an advantage when the peasants arrive
    at the happy time for carrying their corn, as they have only to pull up
    the stakes with the five or ten sheaves on them, and they are easily
    carried. Whilst on the subject of corn-drying, it is a most remarkable
    thing that during the fine weather of the short Norwegian summer the
    wind helps materially by blowing what the natives call a <i>sol-gang</i>:
    the wind goes round with the sun all day, beginning to blow from the
    east in the morning, clue south at mid-day, and north-west in the
    evening.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>Rauma River Boat.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>Having paid especial notice to the Trols, we must turn to the Horn,
    which rises on the left side: 4,000 feet is the height of it, and it
    goes sheer up out of the valley; in fact, one morning, as we were
    sitting by the river, a carriole came hurrying by, and a voice from
    it inquired, “Where’s the Horn?” The old fisherman with me stared at
    the flying folk in search of information, and pointed straight up over
    our heads. The summit has <span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>never been reached yet, either by the
    Government engineers who surveyed the country, or by Alpine men, who
    have all given up the Aiguille Dru as hopeless, or by captive balloon,
    which has been proposed. A very likely party from a yacht made a bold
    attempt at it, but even some of these looked upon it as a hopeless
    case, from the fact that there is a lean-to on a huge shoulder on the
    north-west side. Perhaps the most beautiful time of all to see this
    wild valley is after the first sprinkling of snow, when the tops are
    powdered, which happens when the “iron days” come, the first snow
    falling about August 20th. After a little sharp frost the weather
    recovers from its first shudder, but by the 29th of September all is
    snow again down to the river. Patches of old snow are always lying
    in the valley, even during the hottest summer, but much more in the
    <i>couloir</i>; and, from the immense scale of everything here, the real
    quantity is most difficult to appreciate.</p>

  <p>At the foot of this Romsdal Horn is the Rauma itself, the first fall
    caused by the rocks thrown down when the <i>couloir</i> was originally
    formed; and between the river and the base of the Horn runs the road
    through the valley to Gudbransdalen. There are a few sheep here in the
    advanced farms, and these, like all animals in Norge, are wonderfully
    docile. For some time we heard sounds of music at a distance, but
    could never discover either the music or the musician, until one day
    a boy was found playing in a barn, or <i>laave</i>, on a goat’s horn with
    six holes in it, and with a reed mouthpiece. The sound is quaint. This
    instrument was intended and used for the amusement of the sheep, and
    the boy’s mission was to play to them on it. The sheep and goats here
    always follow instead of being driven; and, like all other animals in
    this country, they are remarkably tame, never exhibiting the least
    signs of fear. This is another pleasant feature resulting from the
    kindliness of the people and their domestic happiness. Long may both
    remain to them!</p>

  <p>The sight of the square-sailed craft with one mast and a bold rampant
    black stem at once shuts out all intrusive thoughts of civilisation,
    for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>these same vessels&mdash;relics of very old days&mdash;are seldom seen
    anywhere save on the wild shores of Heligoland, working down to Bergen,
    or still farther south round by the coast, and up to the town of
    Christiania. These craft are mostly from the north of Trondhjem: their
    lines are very fine indeed forward, the after part, with quarter-deck,
    forming a kind of citadel for the captain. As these vessels come from
    the coast opposite to the Lofoden, they are closely allied with the
    fishery of that district&mdash;the great national fishing ground of Norway,
    to which rushes every able-bodied fisherman from Bergen northwards
    as far as the North Cape. In the month of February the fish are
    in force&mdash;principally early arrivals; and ultimately such immense
    quantities are gathered together that tradition has handed down to us
    as a fact that there are times when a deep-sea line will hardly sink
    through them. Lines and nets are both worked with the greatest system.
    The take is generally tremendous, and the results lucrative. The fish
    are cured as stock-fish until April, when they are split, salted, and
    dried on the rocks like Scotch cod. It is a simple process to gut and
    hang up these cod-fish two and two across poles; not even salt is
    used&mdash;nothing but the sea breezes, sun, and wind. Many years ago the
    takes were even more enormous than at present, amounting to as much as
    16,000,000 fish, or 8,000 tons dried, to say nothing of the cod-liver
    oil and roe; but when we consider that these fish are gradually
    dispersed over Europe, even 8,000 tons would soon go during the period
    of a continental Lent. About April most of the fishers return home, and
    are ready for any chance of herrings, which are as great a blessing to
    the Norwegians as to the Scotch and Irish.</p>

  <p>There was a very striking instance of an old custom in one of the
    outlying fjords, where the fashion of bygone centuries is still
    faithfully kept up. At the entrance of the fjord is a boat, in which is
    stationed the watcher, with a horn or bugle. As soon as the herrings
    are descried the watcher, or rather the look-out, stands up in the bow
    of the boat and sounds his horn. The notes are quickly caught by the
    anxious longing ears on the beach, the boats put off, and soon the
    herrings feel that they are “fish out of water,” and will ere long
    be adding much to the happiness and support of all the <i>bönder</i> and
    agricultural peasantry of the neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>Near our herring scene was a well-to-do but scattered hamlet, for
    it could scarcely be called a village; and, having visited some of
    the good people, who were much interested in the foreigners&mdash;N.B.,
    it is a curious sensation when it first dawns upon the mind of an
    Englishman that he is a regular foreigner in the eyes of others&mdash;we
    came to the conclusion that, all in all, the Norwegian <i>bönder</i>, as
    a class, are more comfortably provided with the good things of this
    world than any other of similar position. Their outdoor life brings
    sound health; they work hard, especially the women; and their reward
    is abundance. Their farms produce all they require to eat, drink, and
    even wear. In the fine weather they work for internal comforts; in
    the bad winter weather they provide for external wants in the form of
    carding, combing, and weaving in their houses, and making <i>vadmel</i>,
    or homespun&mdash;a material in which “shoddy” is unknown, and for which
    “everlasting wear” is the best name. They have their ponies, their
    boats, a wholesome love of God, and veneration for true, practical
    religion. Their houses are of their own building&mdash;sound, solid, and
    warm. There is no money greed amongst them, until spoilt by tasting
    the fruit of the tree of civilisation, and then the reaction is all
    the worse. Another great blessing that remains to them is, that there
    is no tendency to extravagance, no wish to launch out in competition
    with their neighbour. A peaceful, contented, simple life seems to them
    the <i>summum bonum</i>: this they possess, and are careful not to part
    with. Until savings-banks were introduced they really had no use for
    money, and when they acquired silver, instead of investing it, they
    had something new made of it, in this respect strongly resembling the
    old Dutch farmers, who were sometimes quite at a loss to know what
    they should have made next. The latter, indeed, went so far as to have
    candle-boxes, as well as other domestic utensils, of silver. Again,
    Norwegian servants are in good relationship with their masters and
    mistresses: much kindly feeling exists, coupled with a sense of duty
    and a proper regard for relative position, which is never forgotten.</p>

  <p>We have mentioned the “home-madeness” of everything in a Norwegian
    farmer’s house; but we have yet to refer to the woodwork supply,
    namely, sledges, agricultural implements, <i>stolkjærs</i>, rakes, scythe
    handles, carrioles, tankards, teenas (written <i>tine</i>), butter-boxes,
    and bedsteads.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
    These last-mentioned items are the worst things
    produced in the country. The beds are all too short&mdash;never are they
    long enough. It seems as if the Norwegian has not quite grown out of
    the idea that in sleep the body should be bent up with the knees to
    the chin, and in the Isle of Skye tradition assigns to the Norsemen
    certain stone graves composed of nearly square slabs. The only way in
    which a tall traveller in Norway can avoid pushing his feet through
    the footboard is by bending his body up. The best carrioles are built
    at Drammen and Christiania, but they are advanced specimens, with
    springs; and springs are considered a little foppish, as well as liable
    to break, length of shaft being all the spring required. When these
    vehicles have to go on to steamers or large boats&mdash;a very frequent
    necessity, as the whole seaboard is constantly incised by fjords and
    arms of the sea&mdash;it is usual to take off the wheels, when the body is
    soon removed. Where rivers have to be crossed, and a small boat only
    can be procured, the best way is to bring the latter side on to the
    carriole, place a plank with one end on <i>terra firma</i>, and the other
    on the gunwale of the boat, where the wheel of the carriole nearest to
    the shore should ultimately go. The object of this is to run the wheel
    along on this plank to ship the carriole in the boat. This done, there
    is still a difficult part to be performed: the river has to be crossed,
    and if once the balance is lost, all is over. The rush of the river
    is very strong in parts, but even a kind of race makes no difference.
    A pull on one side, then a shoot and a pull on the other, and smooth
    water is reached, safety insured, and the carriole is over. Sometimes
    a river may be forded, but great care should be taken, as the want of
    local knowledge may in a moment cause a loss of life, or at all events
    a ducking.</p>

  <p>We were once fording a river when Old Kyle, our blind dog, was
    travelling very comfortably in a dog-bag, or <i>hund sac</i>, under the
    carriole. The excitement and novelty of the ford made us forget our old
    pet, and the first hint we had of his discomfort was the sorry sight of
    the dog vainly endeavouring to stem the current, while the only way of
    recovering him was by wading back. The carriole is used for everything;
    even the post-carrier is a carriole-driver, and is provided with a
    huge leather bag or portmanteau, with an iron rod running through it,
    and padlocked at the end. The postman <span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>carries a revolver, more as a
    staff of office or official status than anything else, for no one ever
    hears of such a thing as a robbery in this part of the world. The last
    few years have brought about a very great facility of communication in
    Norway, for which all travellers are much indebted to the energy of the
    Government. One can telegraph to any part of Norway for tenpence, and
    the stations are numerous&mdash;surprisingly so, when the extent of country
    and sparseness of population are considered; and for English travellers
    the convenience is very great, because almost all the telegraph-station
    masters speak and write English well.</p>

  <p>The woodcut (see <a href="#Page_55">page 55</a>), with the sea-houses close to the water and
    <i>jægt</i> lying close in, shows the character of the country round that
    beautiful spot in the Hardanger fjord generally known as Rosendal,
    a place of great interest to the historian as the last seat of the
    Norwegian nobility. Nestling in a wood on the rising ground beyond the
    seashore lies this baronial residence, the home of the “last of the
    barons.” Baron Rosenkrone still lives there, and in this secluded spot
    art has been cherished and loved, for Rosendal possesses a collection
    of pictures which is considered <span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>the finest in Norway. Who would
    expect, after trudging for nine hours over the snow expanses of the
    Folgefond, and rapidly descending on the Hardanger fjord, to find there
    such examples of highly civilised life?</p>

  <p>Close to this point is the island of Varalsoe, famous for its sulphur
    mines. It lies out of the regular beaten track, but is sometimes
    visited by the <i>Argo</i> when the steamer is ordered to call for a
    freight. On such occasions the vessel is naturally light, and the first
    shoot of ore sent into the hold from the shipping pier above is, of
    a truth, a shock to the strongest nerves; the rattle and bang of the
    first few waggon or truck loads would startle any one, and make him
    fancy they would go through the ship’s bottom and sink her. Not so,
    however: the people here understand their work, and it is not by any
    means the first time they have shot ore into an empty hold. May it not
    be the last!</p>

    <i>Grave-board, Mølmen Churchyard.</i></span>HE
    Gudbransdalen valley is characterized by an
    immense <i>vand</i>, or lake, which is the source of the two rivers Rauma
    and Logen, the former running south-east, and the latter north-west
    into the Christiania fjord. Coming up from the Rauma valley, it was
    twilight as we reached the plateau of this upper valley, lying about
    4,000 feet above the sea&mdash;a vast mass of far-stretching moorland,
    with heather, matted cotoneaster, and every variety of berry, in all
    the prismatic colour of the west coast of Scotland, but more vast,
    mysterious, and weird; and like witches looming moodily away from
    anything with life, we came ever and anon on some bleached relic of the
    grandeur of those noble Scotch firs which now seem fast fading away
    into mere skeletons and dried bones, the fibre in many cases appearing
    twisted like the strands of a rope, as though the dissolution had been
    one of agony and torture.</p>

  <p>Soon after passing a monolith supposed to have been erected to the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>memory of Sinclair and his Scots we approach Mølmen. Judging from
    its appearance on the map, any one would fancy it to be a town. Such,
    however, is not the case, for it merely consists of a church school,
    open on alternate Sundays, and a station, or farm, for the convenience
    of travellers. Within the last few years this station has greatly
    improved. We arrived late in the evening, and, feeling very chilly,
    huddled up to the fireplace. As we inquired from the <i>pige</i> what
    <i>aftenmad</i> we were likely to obtain, from the depths of the dimness
    of darkness muffled peals came from under a heap of “somethings” in a
    long parallelogramic case, but really a bed, containing the mistress of
    the house, and the muffled peals were to summon a supper for us, and
    quickly. So delighted were we get it, that we said “Tak for mad” before
    we began, instead of waiting till we had finished.</p>

  <p>The church is of wood, larger than most Norwegian churches, and has a
    spire with four turrets, each with an elaborate weathercock. Mølmen
    must at one time have had weathercock on the brain, for there is one
    at the end of the roof, another on the top of the spire and on each of
    the turrets, and even one on the lych gate. This crop of ironwork is
    accounted for by the fact of there having been iron works at Lesje,
    some seven miles farther to the eastward. Passing through the lych
    gate, which is ponderous, the grave-boards attract attention from their
    variety; one in particular had the novel feature of a weathercock on
    the top, and at the back might be seen quite a contrast in sentiment&mdash;a
    small simple iron cross firmly mortised into the solid rock.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>Interior of Mølmen Church.</i></div>
    <div class="larger-version">[<a href="images/i_129f_big.jpg">See larger version</a>]</div>
  </div>

  <p>Entering the church, the general appearance is most striking, very
    quaint old carving, rudely painted&mdash;most comically rudely painted,
    especially on the rood screen, which is above&mdash;running from the pulpit
    to the two pillars in the centre, through which the altar is seen. The
    church floor is strewn with juniper tips, and the altar covered with
    a white linen cloth, whereon were two large candlesticks, which are
    lighted in the great festivals. The panels of the altar are painted in
    rather good colour, the back of it being of a slate colour; and, on the
    right side of it, standing back, is the carved stall for the use of
    the bishop when he visits the district. On the rood screen, over the
    centre, are the arms of King Christian V., with supporters, and above
    these a large but very <span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>uncouth figure of the Saviour on the cross,
    with <span class="smcap">i. h. s.</span> above. On each side is a figure rudely carved
    and painted, as is the case with the pulpit. There are traces, too, of
    the delightful annual custom of these good people, who, when the summer
    bursts suddenly and joyfully upon them, and the flowers come rapidly
    out, cull the earliest, and take them to the church as first-fruits of
    thankful joy. After viewing the front of the altar we went round to the
    back of it&mdash;the Sanctum. This was a treat. There we found old silver
    chalices and curious cases for the sacred wafers; for these good people
    consider the form of worship immaterial, if the spirit be sound. The
    size of the wafer is about one inch and a quarter in diameter.</p>

  <p>A very fine old vestment is still worn for the communion; it is richly
    brocaded, with a large purple cross on the back, and in the centre
    of this is a brass crucifix. The verger said it was a pity to have a
    new one until this was worn out. It certainly wears well, for it has
    been in constant use ever since the Reformation. The great feature,
    however, has yet to be noticed. A curious instrument is used as a
    persuader during the service: it consists of a pole, painted red, about
    eight feet long, with a knob at each end. On inquiring the use of this
    instrument and for what ceremonial, the verger, with surprise at our
    ignorance, said, “To wake the sleepers.” How? “Here, sirs,” continued
    he, placing his hand on his waistcoat, as indicative of the best place
    to tilt at effectually. The reader will be glad to know that the knobs
    did not betray much sign of wear.</p>

  <p>We must now return to the station, which is associated with greyling
    in the river, and wood-carving executed during the winter months in
    the farmhouses&mdash;spoons, bellows, tankards, mangel brats, and culinary
    implements. It was our good fortune to meet at Mølmen a delightful
    Austrian&mdash;his grey and green jacket informed us of that fact&mdash;but his
    general information was an oasis for travellers. A great botanist,
    it was delightful to go out with him, especially as he was, at that
    moment, perfectly mad about saxifrages and the flora of Norway. Then,
    again, “flies.” He had been up the North Cape, to the Namsen and other
    large rivers, and some one had given him a few Namsen “Butcher’s”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
    salmon flies of immense size. These he showed to us; and we, finding
    him so interested, asked him if he would like to see our collection
    of <em>natural</em> flies. “Certainly.” The flies we exhibited were the
    mosquitoes we had shut up between the leaves of note-books when the
    flies had been thickest in our tents on a warm evening. “Ah!” exclaimed
    our Austrian, “ten tousand of dose fellows did I swallow at the North
    Cape, and they bite all the way going down.” Happily, however, he had
    survived. We also met here a distinguished Prussian&mdash;large forefinger
    ring, <i>très Prussien</i>&mdash;whose favourite exercise at the festive board
    astonished us. Mountain strawberries at Mølmen are a treat, and at
    dinner we had some. Our aristocratic foreigner plunged them into a
    tumbler of sparkling wine, but alas! how did he extract them? The
    Count must have been in a lancer regiment, for with a tent-peg action
    he tried to pig-stick each strawberry and raise it to his mouth with
    his toothpick, persevering until the tumbler was emptied, and the last
    strawberry pierced and entombed.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>A Norwegian Salmon Stage.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>In passing along the shores of the fjords a kind of stage may be
    seen occasionally, which would give the casual observer an idea of
    preparations <span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>for pile-driving; but the object of this construction
    is for quite a different purpose. It is one of the dreadful means
    used by the Norwegian farmers to obtain salmon. The system is
    this:&mdash;<em>Netting</em>.&mdash;A man sits in the perch-box; the net is laid round
    to the buoys as indicated in the previous illustration, and, as soon
    as the fisherman (if he may be designated by that name) sees a salmon
    underneath and within his net limit, he hauls in, and generally gets
    him. The salmon, being in the habit of returning to the same river or
    <i>fos</i>, are sometimes the victims of an inquiring mind in the following
    manner:&mdash;The Norwegian whitens the face of the rock, or places a light
    plank so that the fish’s attention may be attracted, and, whilst making
    up his mind as to whether it may be right or wrong, his fate is sealed,
    and he will soon be hung up in the farmer’s house, with two sticks
    across his body. After it has been rubbed with sugar and smoked in
    juniper fumes it is certainly a goodly adjunct to a breakfast; but when
    the weary traveller finds only smoked salmon, he cannot help thinking
    of the days when he was young, and had fresh meat regularly.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow68" id="i_132">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_132.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>Hardanger.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>When coming down from the Haukelid Pass out of Sæterdal to the
    Hardanger, we had not time or space to refer to a very beautiful
    passage between the two, which we will now notice. We came from
    Haukelid a little gloomy; we had seen a corrie which had been the
    scene of a reindeer slaughter, or Glencoe, the result of misplaced
    generosity on the part of an Englishman to a Norwegian. The former had
    given the latter a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>double-barrelled breech-loading rifle, with a good
    battue supply of cartridges. The consequence was that the local Nimrod,
    assisted by a confederate, drove a herd of reindeer into a <i>cul-de-sac</i>
    corrie, and then shot down more than twenty. This was worse than
    the friend who gave his river watcher a salmon rod and flies; the
    <i>elve-wakker</i>, or keeper, fished hard with fly and worm, and with much
    glee wrote to his lord and master in England that he had caught “plenty
    salmons, or <i>stor lax</i>,” and the river would soon be ready for him, but
    he would like two new tops brought out for the rod so kindly given to
    him.</p>

  <p>Journeying from Haukelid, we came down to Roldal, where the pass
    combines to produce a scene of great grandeur. The old wooden bridge,
    the blustering torrent falling with ponderous leap down into a chasm
    below, the serenity and peace of the distant snow range, and the placid
    lake far, far below, formed a combination which causes regret that it
    can never be adequately depicted on paper. The scenery is immensely
    grand, the living proportionately sparse and meagre. It is the old
    story, the quotation of Bennett’s Guide-book&mdash;“Magnificent waterfall at
    back; only two wooden spoons at this station.”</p>

  <p>A tremendous zigzag is being cut by the Government in connection with a
    road which is ultimately intended to be opened over the pass. From the
    top of this zigzag a very commanding view is obtained of the valley of
    Seljestad and the Folgefond&mdash;an immense expanse of snow. We were very
    tired on arriving at Seljestad, and could get nothing but a recorked
    bottle of beer, which must have been put back several times on being
    declined by previous travellers. There was nothing to eat or drink;
    but such a <i>blakken</i>, or Norwegian pony, was put into No. 3 carriole,
    with the proprietor up as <i>skyds</i>. Having gone about five miles, the
    owner thought that the animal was not showing what he could do, or
    even up to his fair average; so, taking the rope reins, he stood up at
    the back of the carriage, grunted at him, and with deep growlings of
    “Elephanta!” sent him flying at a tremendous pace downhill, and, when
    far down the valley, we flew along the road through the spoondrift of
    two fine falls. The owner explained that the pony hated being called an
    elephant, and always went better when a little abused. </p>

    and anon we arrive at some landmark in life which stands out
    prominently for the rest of our terrestrial journey. Perchance it
    is one that, surrounded with pleasant associations, invites us back
    to chew the cud of past happiness, and rises before us as an angel
    of comfort from time to time, when shadows, storms, or squalls of
    trouble cross our path, or the hurry-skurry of advanced civilisation
    has ruffled our calmer nature, and we have become irritable and
    overstrained, liable to spontaneous combustion of temper, and less
    kindly than usual. Such a happy landmark is “after reindeer” in
    Norwegian travel. Let us, then, look back to it, and enjoy it over and
    over again; and may others derive equal pleasure from similar outings!</p>

  <p>The 1st of August is the opening day for reindeer-shooting. About the
    end of July the enthusiasm gradually increases, everything is supposed
    to be ready, lists are gone over, fine weather hoped for, and the 1st
    of August eagerly anticipated. On our way to Gudbransdalen we stopped
    at <span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>Aalesund for the night; and what a night! We had hardly settled
    down to our <i>aftenmad</i>, or supper, before a servant came in to tell us
    of a grand sunset, which she thought the English gentlemen would like
    to see. We all rushed up-stairs, clambered through attics, and finally
    came out on a kind of platform; and what a sight met us here! The whole
    heavens were bathed in the most astounding crimson; at our feet lay
    the harbour of Aalesund, and on the horizon, out in the Atlantic, long
    ultramarine-purple islands. It was sundown in its most intense arctic
    grandeur, with a few golden scraps of cirri in the upper heavens. So
    impressed were we that we mused in silence; adjectives had no power of
    expression; and we tacitly admired with awe and reverence.</p>

  <p>On our return to the table some Cantabs had just arrived, and finding
    we were compatriots, the all-prevailing subject of the latter days of
    July rose to the surface. “Were we going after reindeer?” was followed
    by a sort of mitrailleuse volley of cognate inquiries. They had heard
    of three Englishmen&mdash;did we know them? as they were anxious to meet
    them before starting. At last the suggestion was thrown out, “Had we
    not better go another time?” We thought not. Then they divulged the
    name of him they sought, and the Patriarch revealed himself, quoting
    the <cite>Duke’s Motto</cite>, “I am here.” General rejoicing, fraternity, and a
    <i>skaal</i> for good sport succeeded, and the next morning we all started
    off together by steamer for our happy hunting-grounds.</p>

  <p>On July 31st we made our head habitable quarters on the high plateau of
    the Lesje Vand, and had time to enjoy the detailed study of the upper
    flora and berry varieties, which are numerous in this country. Thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The ponies were packed with their curious birch-twig saddles,
    waterproof sheets for cork bed, deer-skins and air cushions,
    provisions, a small spade to trench round the tents, cooking canteen&mdash;a
    great work most cunningly carried out by the Tentmaster&mdash;lint,
    chlorodyne, &amp;c.; steel nails to screw into boots for ice-work,
    <i>vanters</i>, or mufflers, long flannel night-shirts for cold, blue
    spectacles for snow, a little glycerine, telescope, compass, &amp;c. Our
    beds were made with Iceland moss, waterproof sheet, cork mattress,
    and skins, and we slept in thick socks, gloves, and long flannel
    night-shirts with hood to keep off the flies. Hans Luther was with
    us, and Trophas the faithful, the doggie with sharp nose and curled
    tail. The tents had been sent up to the fjeld before us, and, after
    about six hours’ walk, we spied the white dot&mdash;the tent. In making the
    ascent to the upper plateau the gradual decrease of vegetation was
    very noticeable, culminating in the reindeer flower, or <i>Ranunculus
    glacialis</i>, which is much liked by the reindeer. Happy and buoyant with
    hope the hunter who finds the flowers nibbled off! Their peculiarity
    is to grow most freely where the snow has melted back. At the tents we
    found Ole of Lesje, whose first news was that he had seen a herd of
    about fifty reindeer, after which an important subject was mooted: a
    glutton had been seen the night before near the tent. Danjel Kulingen
    had been thirteen years after reindeer, and had never seen one. On
    the other hand, Hans Luther had shot one, and there was a skin at
    the station at Mølmen, which reminded us that at fishing inns on the
    banks of the Thames larger fish are seen stuffed and glazed than the
    itinerant angler generally hooks and lands.</p>

  <p>All at once the dogs, three in number&mdash;Trophas, Barefoed, and
    Storm&mdash;opened a barking chorus; but we did not seize our rifles, as
    the telescopes revealed our Paymaster-general, who was returning from
    his <i>chasse de bagage</i>, which he had happily recovered. The aneroids
    registered 5,000 feet, and all was full of promise, save the one fact
    that the rifle of our <span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>friend was below in the valley. The despair
    and ferocity engendered by this unhappy discovery were soon dispelled
    by good food, and plenty of it, a word of comfort and sympathy, and
    last, not least, a little whiskey, after which he took a siesta in his
    tent, on which we wrote “Requiescat in pace,” and left our cards as a
    welcome. Being Sunday, we made it quite a day of rest, and revelled in
    the flora, mosses, and lichens of our new ground, always, however, with
    an eye to the glutton, which evidently had a day of rest also, as he
    never appeared. In the evening, at 6.30, we had a hunters’ chorus, for
    the Norwegian Sunday terminates at six o’clock.</p>

  <p>Ole sang “Saga’s Hall.” Luther, with his sweet high tenor, was very
    good, and eventually a bouquet was thrown to him. The delicate
    attention seemed to be appreciated, although it was composed of straw
    and red labels from the tin cans of our preserved meats, &amp;c. Then we
    had a bar or two of “God save the Queen,” and so into our tents. The
    next day we made a long journey, with much snow and heavy winds. In
    the afternoon we had to swim the ponies through a river&mdash;a very pretty
    sight indeed&mdash;the only drawback being clouds of mosquitoes. They were
    perfectly awful, and no avoiding them. We were even thankful to think
    we should not have them at home for a continuance, for the remark that
    we should soon get used to them afforded no comfort.</p>

  <p>At this altitude we found the ptarmigan sitting about. The shooting
    of these birds does not commence until August 15th, and they seemed
    to know that we, as Englishmen, would not shoot before that day. So
    we actually threw stones at them, and one old bird, when knocked off
    the top of a large stone, positively came back to see what it was all
    about. Soon after this we discovered <i>freske spör</i> (new deer slots).
    The dogs livened up for a time. All soon settled, however, into steady
    travel again. Danjel was telescoping continually, but frequently a
    supposed reindeer turned out to be only a stone in the snow, till at
    last the Patriarch ventured to remark that there were “mange stor steen
    in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>Gamle Norge, og maget god telescope jagt,” which Danjel understood
    to suggest real deer instead of stones, and we should all have
    preferred, as it was one of the objects of our expedition, shooting
    reindeer to telescoping them. They are very wild, and quite justify the
    old saying, “Mange dyr, mange øine” (many deer, many eyes). Our course
    now lay from Buvalden due north, and we started in good time from
    Thorbvu for the snow ranges, leaving the horses and baggage below, we
    going as light as possible, with our own food for the day, and plenty
    of goat cheese. At lunch Danjel explained to the Patriarch that he
    should eat much goat cheese, for if he eat sufficient he should partake
    of the nature of that saltatory animal, and in time jump cleverly and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
    boldly from rock to rock&mdash;an accomplishment in much requisition during
    our wanderings.</p>

  <p>An incident of piscatorial interest occurred here. We sent a hunter,
    who had never had a rod in his hand before, down to a lake, or <i>vand</i>,
    to try for some trout. In an hour he came back with about twenty,
    averaging nearly one pound each. Of course he was not casting, or
    “flick” would have been the fate of the fly; he only trailed. Still his
    success was perfect, and he was delighted with his new sport.</p>

  <p>The male reindeer are called <i>bucks</i>, the female <i>ko</i> and <i>semle ko</i>,
    and the young <i>kalve</i>. In the daytime they roll in the snow, and if
    they sleep at all, it is certainly with one eye open. Having seen
    and telescoped many large stones, and taken them for deer, there was
    a strong inclination to inquire more closely as to the probability
    of sport, and a suppressed anxiety to hear a definite opinion as to
    our chance of a shot, if nothing more. The hunter must be patient,
    persevering, careful not to appear even as a moving speck on the
    interminable expanse of virgin snow, and take his sport quietly, for
    better or worse. Our Tentmaster had made many expeditions, had seen
    many deer, and even when his chance came an impetuous&mdash;shall we say
    friend?&mdash;rushed out in front of him, fired, and missed. So tradition
    said. We are glad to state that this did not occur during our present
    trip. His successes arrived, however, after a time, and never will he
    forget the day when he killed his first reindeer. Long may he live to
    kill more!</p>

  <p>Let us here give his first experience; so pray silence for the
    Tentmaster.</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">The Tentmaster’s First Trip, and How He Tried to Get a
      Reindeer.</span></h3>

  <p>“In the year 1863 I ascended the glorious Norwegian fjelds for the
    first time to hunt reindeer. What a charm is conveyed in these words,
    ‘first time!’ The first salmon or trout caught; the first grouse or
    partridge shot; the first meet at cover and burst with the hounds; the
    first climb up the snow peaks of Switzerland; the young beauty’s first
    London season,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
    or first night at the opera or ball; and last, not
    least, first love, all have a peculiar zest never afterwards equalled.”</p>

  <p>(N.B.&mdash;The Tentmaster is rather sentimental.)</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>After Sport.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>“I experienced this feeling in August, 1863, when, journeying up the
    magnificent Romsdal valley, on arriving at a station I noticed a
    splendid head of reindeer horns lying outside the station-house. On
    inquiry I found that a Norwegian hunter had brought them down from the
    fjelds. I lost no time in searching him out, and soon arranged for
    an expedition together. I had no provisions, tents, spare clothing,
    or other appliances which my subsequent experience has shown to be
    requisite, but began the ascent with the meagre store of some raw
    coffee berries, <i>flatbrod</i>, cheese, and biscuits. The hunter (Dan I
    call him) could not speak English, nor I Norske; but we got on pretty
    well by pantomime. After a pleasant but toilsome three hours’ walk
    through the grand scenery peculiar to the Norwegian fjelds, Dan’s
    hound Passop (the reindeer hounds are held in a leash two or three
    yards long) suddenly squatted down in great excitement, with his nose
    steadily pointed to a huge rock about three hundred <span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>yards distant,
    and gave a peculiar low whine. Dan was down immediately, and signalled
    me to do the same. He was certain that reindeer were close at hand, but
    a full half-hour’s telescoping failed to disclose their whereabouts.
    Nothing could induce Passop to move; his sniffing nose kept steadily
    in the direction of the rock; while he occasionally gave us a most
    intelligent, imploring look, as much as to say, ‘Do something.’ Unable
    to see any trace of deer, we dare not move. Dan thought that wherever
    they were, there they would remain some time; so, with faithful Passop
    on the watch, we determined to have lunch. Not a bite, however, would
    Passop touch&mdash;not even <i>flatbrod</i> thick with butter. There he squatted,
    with his nose still to the rock, the model of a watchful sentinel.
    Lunch finished, Dan began telescoping, and soon discovered the cause of
    Passop’s agitation. The tips of antlers were visible above the rock,
    and in distinct relief against the sky. They were perfectly motionless;
    but we were quite sure, after many exciting inspections with the
    telescope, that a large buck was resting behind the rock. As the wind
    was not very favourable Dan said we must be quite still, and remain
    till we saw a movement. In my innocence I wished to smoke a pipe, but
    Dan forbade it. The excitement was increased by Dan saying it was a
    large buck, probably an outlying sentinel, and that a herd of deer was
    not far off, which proved correct. Our patience being exhausted, Dan,
    much to the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>delight of Passop, ordered a forward crawling movement;
    and, with time and patience, we got within eighty yards of the rock,
    where we determined to halt and wait. The tops of the antlers were
    still motionless. Poor Passop was trembling with excitement, and his
    companions much the same. In this position another half-hour passed,
    when suddenly Dan exclaimed, ‘Look!’ Passop became very uneasy, when
    we had the pleasure of seeing a splendid <i>stor buck</i> rise up and stand
    before us broadside, with his head turned to where we were crouching.
    Passop behaved splendidly, remaining perfectly still, while I shall
    never forget the expression of his eyes, and his occasional side glance
    at us, as much as to say, ‘Now then.’ Resting my rifle on a convenient
    rock, I took aim steadily behind the shoulder, pulled the trigger, and,
    to my horror, it missed fire. The buck heard the snap, and started off
    at a rattling pace; Passop struggled wildly to get out of the leash;
    and Dan exclaimed, ‘Gud bevar mig! Give me my riffel.’ I handed it to
    him, he recapped it, and fired at about two hundred yards’ distance
    without effect. Passop collapsed, and the translation of his thoughts
    into English was indicated by the expression of his face,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
    ‘I have done my best!’ No doubt he had a clear conscience; and work being
    finished, he commenced eating <i>flatbrod</i> and butter with great zest.
    The inevitable pipes were now brought out for consolation. Wonderful
    weed&mdash;exquisite after a success, soothing after a defeat!</p>

  <p>“We now made our way to a stone cave to pass the night, where we
    had coffee and <i>flatbrod</i>. The cave was just large enough for me to
    creep in, and I passed the night on dried moss, sleeping soundly till
    daybreak. The night being very fine, Dan took up his quarters outside
    the cave, had coffee, and slept soundly on dried moss too. After
    breakfast we started, Dan being sure we should find the herd. At one
    o’clock we discerned them, fourteen in number, taking their noonday
    siesta on the snow; but in vain we tried to get within shot. Next day
    we saw herds of deer, but without being able to get within range on
    account of the quantity of snow. On the third day I returned to the
    station, much delighted with my first reindeer-hunting experiences.
    Often as I have been on the fjelds since, the three days of 1863 have
    not been surpassed, although</p>

  <p>It would be well here to say a few words respecting the tents and their
    arrangement.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

  <p>A regular <i>tente abri</i> carries two very well. Of course there are
    more room and comfort for a single inhabitant; still, for general
    travelling, in which luggage may only too truly be described as
    <i>impedimenta</i>, the tent referred to may be used. Every morning, if the
    weather permits, the waterproof sheet and cork bed should be laid out
    to dry, and the skins also. The trench round the tent must be well
    looked to, the lines tightened, and the ponies tethered, as it is
    rather disagreeable to be awakened about two <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> by a storm
    of rain and wind, and to discover your pony, with his linked fore-legs
    well tangled in tent lines, doing his best to pull down the whole
    concern on the heads of the occupants. Far more delightful is it to be
    aroused on a bright, crisp, and fresh summer morning, when, if near a
    <i>sæter</i>, the cause of it may be the jodelling of a <i>pige</i> in charge
    of the cows&mdash;Swiss as to character of song, exceedingly Norske as she
    calls to them to follow. In the country districts animals follow more
    frequently than they are driven. Kindliness is the rural, coercion the
    town influence.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Many of our readers will notice that under the initial letter at
    the commencement of this chapter, the powder-flask and general
    arrangement are very much like the old bandoleers still hanging in the
    guard-chamber of Hampton Court Palace and others at Portsmouth. They
    were most general in Charles I.’s time, and are beautifully shown in De
    Gheyn’s costumes of Culverin-men and Harquebusiers. In this case the
    bandoleer <span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>was made of steel, and it is faithfully rendered, with the
    cord by which the whole arrangement was hung over the shoulder of the
    hunter.</p>

  <p>By this time we deserve sport. We have travelled far and worked hard
    for it. Let us see the result. We had arrived at a great height, at the
    snow-fields called Sneebreden, like the Folgefond in the Hardanger, We
    had slid, crawled, and struggled, sometimes moving one behind the other
    at an angle to reduce our surface, creeping on the crisp, dry, hard
    snow, wading rivers of snow-water (very cold tubbing indeed), sloshing
    at the edge of the snow, where the reindeer-flowers bloom, and going
    through various other incidents of snow travelling, till at last we
    arrived at a smart drop, previous to another <i>fond</i>. Here the Patriarch
    had to be eased down, and his pendent position is only suggested in
    the cut (<a href="#Page_147">p. 147</a>). Soon Trophas began to draw upon some slots in the
    snow, and it was the unanimous opinion that they were “fresh.” Trophas
    pulled hard, held back by Ole, who eventually began to half trot. To
    the unsentimental mind the action was that of a blind man’s dog eyeing
    coppers in the distance; but Trophas was in earnest, and at last the
    top of a horn burst upon us, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>in a second our fate was disclosed
    to us. There was nothing but the gralloch of a reindeer <i>kalve</i> shot
    yesterday&mdash;one horn, one hoof, &amp;c.&mdash;as shown in the sketch (<a href="#Page_148">p. 148</a>).
    How could it be accounted for? Many suggestions were thrown out, many
    improbabilities considered feasible, and at last a matter-of-fact mind
    launched the frightful proposition that the glutton seen by Ole near
    our tents the night before our arrival was nothing but a native hunter,
    who had been stalking us, and had killed the <i>kalve</i> of which the
    remains were now at our feet. Nothing daunted, we flattered ourselves
    that at all events we had now commenced in earnest, and remembered the
    saw that the worst beginning has the best ending.</p>

    <span class="drop-img illow25"><img src="images/i_150.jpg" alt="T" /></span>RAVELLERS
    in Norway are surprised, as they pass
    through the valleys, to see so few cows. This is easily explained.
    They visit this interesting country when these animals are away, like
    themselves, for a holiday; and as every dog has his day, so every
    Norwegian cow has her outing, and goes to the grass pastures in the
    upper plateau to enjoy life until the white mantle of snow is ready
    to garb the upper ranges and drive the cows and <i>piger</i> down to their
    homesteads and winter quarters. As already described, these <i>sæters</i>,
    or <i>châlets</i>, are high up, and frequently afford the energetic
    nature-loving traveller and genuine hunter cover and shelter, we may
    almost say comfort&mdash;<i>cum</i> very much <i>grano</i>, though. In snow-work
    it becomes almost luxury to have one of these to fly to in very bad
    weather. Tent life is the most truly enjoyable thing&mdash;though there
    are times when a tent may be blown down and soaked through&mdash;to say
    nothing of the milk supply at hand, which is meat and drink at all
    times, although very filling at the Norwegian price. This will account
    for our associating a <i>sæter</i> so prominently with our snow-work. The
    one given in our woodcut (<a href="#Page_149">p. 149</a>)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
    was inhabited by Maritz, who was
    there by herself from July to the beginning of September or end of
    August, according to the early or late fall of the snow. The 20th of
    August generally brings the first fall of snow in this latitude (63°).
    During our stay we always slept in our tents, as we all feared the
    parasitical ticklings the <i>sæter</i> would inevitably have afforded us
    had we given it the chance. All the summer through the old snow lay
    round the antiquated wooden building, and seldom indeed was it that
    Maritz had any one to speak to, as there was no road or path of any
    kind. Still she was all kindness. Did she not send a pair of cuffs to
    the Patriarch’s wife, and iron them, so to speak, after her manner,
    with the back of a wooden spoon, as she hummed a plaintive ditty in the
    minor key? Perhaps she thought the lady would hardly like to wear them,
    or else that they might find their way to some great people. Maritz,
    too, held to the superstitions of her ancestors. Thus her porridge
    swizzle-stick&mdash;which is like the West Indian swizzles, but larger&mdash;made
    from the five-shoot top of a young fir, was always prepared with a
    cross cut at the end or swizzling part of it, to keep the Evil One from
    turning the milk sour. This, too, she sent with the cuffs.</p>

  <p>A little outdoor shed, or <i>laave</i>, was our general cooking-place,
    into which four of us sometimes squeezed, and, as the dogs filled up
    the interstices, we were as closely packed as sardines, the whole
    being seasoned with the oil of good fellowship. It is wonderful how
    invigorating this life is. What a system for a sanatorium! How well
    balanced should one become with such fresh air, simple food, and
    exercise, and with all the energy and toughness requisite for this
    work! It is inconceivable how kindly, obliging, and tender towards
    others a life like this makes us. Such was the influence of our
    head-quarters. Prosiness must be avoided, however; so another day on
    the snow with the hopes of sport, and no buck fever if we get a chance.
    Bad landmark that, if perchance it befall us. We hope it will not: if
    it do we will forget it.</p>

  <p>For our line the shortest way would be across the <i>vand</i> where the
    trout were caught, and Danjel reported the discovery of an old boat
    of that class which has no iron nails about it, but all wooden pegs,
    and yet not particularly inviting as to safety, as the baling-ladle of
    birch wood <span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>gave the idea that whoever last used it thought it would be
    wanted by the next comer. However, as the hunters were agreeable and
    we could all swim, we determined to try it. So off we started, with
    ominous gurglings and washings to and fro in the bottom of the boat,
    fast, frequent, and furious. The ladle was heartily plied, first by one
    strong arm, then by another; but still the water came. This brought to
    our remembrance the Scottish Highland custom of baling the boat with
    a good large shoe, and that if you only take a pair the power becomes
    doubled.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Happily we arrived safely, and soon started for a long day’s work
    over unknown ground. The weather had cleared, and everything seemed
    to combine in our favour. There was a hearty good spirit among our
    hunters and ourselves, each fellow wishing the other good sport, and
    the dogs were keen to a degree. They longed for a revenge after the
    affair of the old gralloch, and flattered themselves that, if we were
    not unlucky, they would get fresh blood before nightfall. We were soon
    beginning to ascend steadily, and about an hour after starting, the
    Patriarch, working <span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>his way under some overhanging rocks, met with a
    surprise. An eagle, a large specimen, swept over his head and shadowed
    him. With his rifle in its case and across his back, the noble bird
    was safe, and the Patriarch delighted. Must there not be a nest? Yes,
    there was. Rough sticks and the lightest of down feathers were all that
    it was made of&mdash;rude, simple, and, one would think, uncomfortable for
    so grand a bird. Some of the down feathers were taken as a souvenir,
    and now and then brought out and floated, so light are they, in
    recollection of our having found one of the noblest of birds at home.</p>

  <p>By mid-day we were out on the open snow, with hardly any rock shelter
    for stalking, should fortune favour us. The reindeer, however, were not
    “at home;” so we stopped at a suitable rock for lunch. How we enjoyed
    it! Old Trophas wagged his tail with a conviction that “no <span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>sport, no
    food,” would never be his fate as long as there was something left in
    our wallets. So we all rejoiced together, winding up with a little
    whiskey and hearty wishes for good sport.</p>

  <p>Soon after lunch the tips of some horns were just visible on the
    snow-line. A large expanse of snow lay before us, with some small rocks
    half-way. Could we reach them? No; so we waited for the chance of the
    deer working up our way. Unfortunately they moved in the opposite
    direction, and our chance was gone. Still we had seen some, and that
    inspired fresh hope. Later in the afternoon we again saw a herd, and
    telescoped them for a length of time. Soon after this a second herd
    became visible, and it was most interesting to watch their manœuvres,
    which we did until they joined and moved off&mdash;of course in the opposite
    direction. An immense expanse of snow was now before us, and once we
    saw four herds of reindeer, and could count about one hundred and
    forty. For a long time we had hope, and agreed that if we could only
    get one we should be satisfied; but even that was denied, for the four
    herds gradually blended and went straight off, leaving us in the most
    perfect solitude, reindeerless.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>

  <p>By this time we had a long distance to travel to get back to our tents.
    Fortunately the light fades so little that it hardly signifies; still
    great care is required to judge of the best footing after leaving the
    snow, as the hunter leads, and can go any way, even to rolling down
    places like a hedgehog, and sometimes sitting down for a slide. Indeed,
    going home becomes a kind of steeple-chase over unknown ground. In such
    cases woe and grief must be the fate of the novice. At the highest
    elevation we passed an immense boulder, very much like the Logan Stone,
    and of similar dimensions, though perhaps larger. On the top of this
    was a much smaller one, but of different geological formation. This
    gave rise to considerable discussion about the glacial theory, as there
    was a non-believer present. What could have produced this remarkable
    combination but the action of glaciers passing over the surface,
    bearing huge masses of rock from distant parts, and, as the ice melted
    away, depositing them? These boulders were found at an elevation of
    5,000 feet or more. We also met with a most interesting instance of
    pink snow, very marked <span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>indeed in colour. All these varied phases of
    nature did much to repay us for our disappointment respecting the deer.
    This the difficulties of the descent also made us for the time forget,
    as Danjel Kulingen was tearing away as hard as he could possibly go,
    sometimes letting himself down, then hanging on to the undergrowth of
    heather, sliding, rolling, or jumping. We often solaced ourselves with
    the idea that if we could only get him on the flat for ten miles for a
    finish, we could give him a spin and run him in at high speed.</p>

  <p>Whilst we had been telescoping the deer our Aalesund friend was having
    sport. On our return we found that he had been over to our tent to see
    us, and had left word of “Sport, sport,” and a message to try for a
    meet. This, unfortunately, could not be arranged, or we should have
    seen joy depicted on his face when he described to us where and how he
    killed his first reindeer.</p>

  <p>The Norwegians believe that the horns of the reindeer, boiled down,
    are good for consumptive people. There is no doubt that the reindeer
    themselves eat, or rather gnaw them when they are shed, which occurs
    in November. The males shed their horns first, the females retaining
    them longer. We found several horns partially gnawed through, and, when
    we consider the number of deer, there must be some reason why the shed
    horns are not more frequently picked up. The same idea of horn soup
    for consumptive cases occurs in Scotland, where the horns of red deer
    are also found gnawed. One would imagine that the best time for this
    <i>potage</i> would be when the horn was first formed, and the “velvet” is
    on, or when the horn is being renewed; and during this period it is
    very warm indeed, as large arteries run inside the velvet, or horn
    skin, and are engaged in depositing bone on the old stems, until the
    horns are complete and the velvet fretted off in September.</p>

  <p>The reindeer, like ptarmigan, become white during the winter, and in
    their wild state present a great contrast to the sheeplike tameness of
    those possessed by Laplanders. The Laps have a regular call for their
    tame deer, which generally come at once; but if not, the proprietor has
    generally his lasso with him, which is thrown over the animal’s loins,
    and he is at once a prisoner. The good travelling pace of reindeer is
    well <span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>known, being about ten miles an hour, with two hundred pounds
    weight at their back. In their wild state their pace was beyond
    computation when we were behind them. We could well say that we had
    been “after reindeer,” and that is all. The only way to have sport in
    such a country as Norway is patiently to settle down to it, without
    fixing a time for returning. A river is not always right, nor the water
    in condition. So is it with the reindeer hunter: a thousand things
    may occur to mar his success. The very wind is sometimes wrong, and
    may chop round at the moment when he hopes it will hold on steadily
    for an hour or two; while, on the other hand, it may change at some
    fortunate moment exactly in his favour. No; there is no royal road to
    such sports as these. The charm of uncertainty must at all times attach
    to real sport. It must be worked for, and directly the uncertainty
    is removed its real charm is gone, and the relish for it dissipated.
    The mere act of shooting and killing lasts but a second of time; it
    is the surroundings which afford the real pleasure&mdash;the fresh air,
    the change of scene, the care required in every detail, the sportsman
    never knowing but that the very next moment some interesting incident
    may transpire which would make the day, hour, and spot a landmark; the
    necessity for watching every breath of air, the most delicate zephyr
    being registered and measured by the painstaking hunter, as he brings
    out tenderly some carefully preserved pieces of the finest floss silk,
    or, better far, some of the eagle’s down feathers already alluded to.
    Again, the dogs require constant attention; and, to be quite complete,
    a coronet of eagles’ eyes&mdash;optical all-rounders&mdash;would be an assistance.</p>

    for salmon, and the love which Englishmen
    have for that grandest of all sports, have led to the opening up of
    Norway to the general traveller. Our first pioneers, finding how
    importunate were the inquiries of the new-comers respecting the best
    spots and methods for sport, and that the inclination of some led them
    to try and bid above others for the waters they had really well earned
    by their own energy and perception&mdash;all this, we say, tended to make
    men on board the good ship <cite>Tasso</cite> rather <em>taciturn</em>. (Excuse the
    approach to an unintentional pun.) This, however, is not surprising,
    for men are compelled to be reticent when they know the inevitable
    consequences of giving details of their sport. Nothing will secure
    success but earnest work, patience, and biding your time for the happy
    combination which the best rivers can only afford now and then. Why, as
    we have just observed, the whole charm of sport would be dispelled if
    it became a dead certainty, and a man knew he would kill so many pounds
    of fish one day, and none the next. No; like the glorious uncertainty
    of cricket and hunting, the uncertainty of fishing is one of its
    charms; the average of good and bad is equalised, and the old French
    proverb comes in, that “Patience et longueur de temps font plus que la
    rage.” The noble salmon has become liable to increased and more subtle
    dangers within the last few years, besides his old natural enemies. The
    peasants have new means of torture. His natural foes are the bull-trout
    and sea-trout, which are the vermin of every river, destroying the
    spawn wholesale, and even lying in wait for the moment when the female
    deposits her milt, an instance of which came under our observation.
    The nets at the mouth of the river are an old institution, but they
    should be well constructed and supervised; also the <i>tine</i>, or stage,
    described in a former chapter, where the <i>bonde</i> is anything but the
    “sweet little cherub that sits up <span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>aloft;” still it is an old custom,
    and we like old customs. So also is the “worm box” which hangs from the
    peasant’s belt as he goes for some trout, or anything else that may be
    tempted. The worm box is a very primitive construction, its simplicity
    being well carried out in the birch twig by which it is suspended,
    and the two pieces of leather through which the lid slides. It is a
    picturesque relic of old days.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>Worm Box.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>We now approach the recent diabolical invention of the “otter,” which,
    sad to relate, must have been introduced thoughtlessly by some one
    who little knew what damage he was doing when, for his own selfish
    gratification, he fell back upon so unlawful and unsportsmanlike
    an expedient. Even to obtain food such poaching is unjustifiable.
    Certainly enough could have been taken for that purpose by fair means.
    It is of no use, however, dilating upon this; the deed is done, and
    otters cannot be withdrawn now. If the arm of the law were stretched
    forth, “les pommes volées” would become more than ever “les plus
    douces.” Then, again, the kindly feeling engendered by good sport and
    a certain sense of gratitude frequently leads, at the end of a visit,
    to a gift of flies, perhaps even of a rod. In illustration of this let
    us repeat the case of the proprietor of a river who gave to Nils, his
    <i>elve-wakker</i>, a salmon rod and flies. Early in the season Nils began
    to avail himself of the new fishing-gear, and soon wrote home to his
    benefactor to say that the salmon were coming up the river, but that
    he had broken both tops of the rod, and lost most of the flies; would
    the gentleman kindly send out some more flies and tops to get the
    river ready for him? We do not think this was done; it could hardly be
    expected that any man would like all the salmon he killed to be landed
    with more than one fly, perhaps one in his mouth, one in each fin, and
    finally one in his tail. What an awful apparition for even the merest
    tyro! Such liberality is simply mistaken kindness. This brings to mind
    other stories concerning salmon-fishing.</p>

  <p>It is often remarked that “truth is stranger than fiction.” When an
    M.P. fishing in Scotland played and held his fish all night, and on
    the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>following morning lost him, and a friend of his afterwards killed
    a salmon with one of the M.P.’s favourite flies in his tail, that was
    certainly an event, but hardly to be compared with what we are about to
    relate. In the large rivers of Norway a fishing may extend four miles,
    and the fishing next to that only three, so that different waters are
    let to different persons. In the present instance our foreign Izaak
    Walton was fishing the very top water, and, as good luck would have it,
    hooked a <i>stor lax</i>, perchance a forty-pounder. He played him firmly
    and steadily, but the fish after a time got the gentleman at the reel
    end of the rod through the next water and the next. Hours rolled on,
    yet still down they went, and by the next morning arrived at a shallow
    part of the river. A Norwegian peasant came up, and, despite the
    national dislike to going into the water, plunged into the river, and
    walked out with the <i>stor lax</i> in his arms&mdash;<span class="smcap">dead</span>, and reported
    that he must have been dead for the <em>last five hours</em>. Nevertheless he
    got him, and a fine fish he was, with one fly in the right place.</p>

  <p>The Norwegians have a great admiration and respect for a good
    fisherman. One morning, speaking of the average sport of the river,
    and referring to that of last year, we inquired if &mdash;&mdash; were a good
    fisherman. Knut answered emphatically, “No; he is a poor man, a very
    poor man.” We naturally replied, “But in England he is a very rich
    man.” “Ah!” said Knut with strong emphasis, “when he was here he was no
    richer than we, but the flies bite him much more.” What contentment!
    no envying, although a latent satisfaction creeps out, which decidedly
    evinces an undercurrent of thought.</p>

  <p>Trout-fishing has the great charm of taking Piscator into the most
    lovely and retired spots. The salmon, as a larger fish, takes us to
    a grander scale of nature. The water of the cheerful little trout
    stream is changed for the rushing river, and the comparatively low
    bank sometimes gives place to a position like that in the annexed
    illustration, which was taken from above a grand pool, the Stige-steen,
    or Ladder Rock, connecting it with the side of the river.</p>

  <p>Having said somewhat of fishing, let us now turn to the “aldermanic
    view” of the salmon, and hark back to a happy day when a lady had
    killed a nice fish, about fourteen pounds and a half, which was to be
    cooked on the spot: it is well to observe the process and make a note
    thereof. Cut the salmon in slices, and boil them for ten minutes; then
    let the water in which they were cooked boil on, with the head added;
    put in a little fresh butter, pepper, and salt, and serve as gravy
    or sauce. With a Norwegian appetite it is perfect, and very simple.
    N.B.&mdash;Fish killed at noon, served at two <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> This is fresh
    fish, and contrasts most favourably with the frozen salmon which
    travels ice-bound to the metropolis of Great Britain.</p>

  <p>Evening is the best time for fishing, and the long twilight, which
    helps the enthusiast for trout and salmon fishing at eleven or twelve,
    can only be realised by those who know the glories of the North. It
    seems a curious thing to take, when travelling, a green blind in order
    to exclude the light when wishing to go to sleep; still it is necessary
    at first, although Nature is so elastic that she readily adapts herself
    to circumstances, when the green blind can be given to some new-comer,
    or lent as a passing boon.</p>

  <p>One word in reference to the illustration, “A Good Beginning.” It was
    our last morning: wind, rain, mist low down&mdash;in fact, blowing hard.
    No. 3 was up at five <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and found the Tentmaster-general
    had passed a restless night, every coverlet and blanket being
    knotted, twisted, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>twined into the most perfect disorder. This
    was attributed to the fact that it was his last night that season in
    Norway, and his usually placid sleep had been disturbed with Norske
    nightmare. He must have been dreaming of trolds and <i>nökken</i>, and
    fancied that he was gaffing ogres or <i>bjergtrolds</i> instead of fine
    clean fish. The weather was the last straw which broke the camel’s
    back&mdash;he would not go. “You go,” was his rejoinder. So the Patriarch
    went; and this was the result to greet his companions when they came
    down to breakfast.</p>

    is a great charm about the freedom of driving
    one’s own pony and carriole, or <i>stolkjær</i>, for a long run, or even for
    a short excursion; it conduces to the peaceful rest we are all longing
    for, and saves one from reminders that at the next station the horses
    will be charged for if we do not hurry on. This is rather tantalising
    when one is drinking in nature, and realising the fact that each moment
    is revealing fresh beauties and developing lifelong impressions&mdash;the
    very time when one wants to be left to nature and himself. In the
    excursion now before us we had our own ponies part of the way, and
    pedestrianism for cross country. Our route was from Romsdal, the weird
    valley where, on the previous evening, the trolds had been playing
    pranks in the following manner:&mdash;About 8.30 a tremendously heavy roll
    as of thunder, lasting forty seconds, brought us suddenly to the
    window. The mist was hanging round the peaks, with cirri-strati across
    them; down came the <i>steen-skreed</i>, or slip, with a mighty rush; and
    the cloud was driven out by the shower of rocks and stone as they came
    madly down. It was unusually grand. The sheep boy with his horn ran in,
    Anna rushed to the door to see it, and as she came the dust rose up in
    a cloud as incense after Nature’s work. Ole remarked that it was a fine
    shower, and very impressive it certainly was; still Anna said she did
    not like it. In some cases in the winter-time the peasants go on to the
    ice to avoid the possibility of these erratic masses reaching them.</p>

  <p>We were soon off to Gudbransdalen, calling as usual at Fladmark&mdash;that
    lovely spot, beautiful to a degree if you have provisions. Should such
    be the case, you certainly must have brought them, for the station
    is not one of refreshment, as Mrs. Brassey testified by her anxiety
    to regain her yacht, the <cite>Sunbeam</cite>, which is truly a sunbeam to her
    friends. Long may it be so to her and her husband and son!</p>

  <p>We must leave the hurly-burly of rocks through which the Rauma
    dashes in this part. Rocks the size of detached villas seem to have
    been “chucked” about, for this is the only term we can bestow upon
    such higgledy-piggledy positions. One can only realise the idea by
    imagining <span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>one’s self a minute insect in a basin of lump sugar, with a
    great rushing river beneath.</p>

  <p>Arriving at Mølmen, we found it a most healthy spot, and worth staying
    at for a time, as the people are so kind, and the whole surroundings
    inviting. Being on a high plateau, the air is perfect, and the place
    seems to be more than usually fortunate in its weather. The following
    morning, there being no service at kirk, we availed ourselves of the
    perfect weather for enjoyment on the hillside. Striking off from the
    houses, we sauntered up through the stunted birch and the heather till
    the grey rocks became more prominent, the vegetation sparse, the plants
    closer to the ground, and then we lay down on the fjeld side. What a
    view there was beneath us! The whole scene was a rare combination of
    all the prismatic colours so characteristic of Scotland in October.
    At our feet was the long Lesje Vand, beyond that the Dovre fjeld,
    and we fancied we could see Sneehatten; then, away to the right,
    were snow ranges to Storhættan, which is ascended from Ormem. How we
    basked in the sunlight and longed for more life on the fjeld! “Why
    should we not go to Eikesdal?” said Ole all at once. “That would be
    fine: why not?” The idea was caught at. “How long would it take to
    walk, Ole?” “Well, eighteen hours if there is no mist.” “Very well,
    then; no mist, if you please, and we will do it.” This was a new joy:
    eighteen hours’ walk without a house to call at, carrying one’s own
    nosebag, and great doubts as to a bed on arriving&mdash;more delightful
    still! This is enjoyment indeed, though not to every one, perhaps. We
    therefore decided to start the next morning at three <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, provided
    there was neither mist on the mountains nor the chance of it. How we
    revelled on the journey in anticipation, enhanced as our happiness was
    by the beauty of the scene and the grandeur of the surroundings! All
    the way down we conversed on our coming walk, interrupted only by a
    visit <span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>to a farm, where we heard some of the good folk singing. It was
    hay-time; the weather fine, with a refreshing breeze that gently waved
    the new-cut grass as it hung from the frames, like huge towel-horses,
    which are used for drying it. We were invited to enter the farmhouse,
    where we found the room tidied up for Sunday, and the family singing
    a hymn in their customary devotional manner. There was the usual
    three-cornered cupboard; an old gun which had laid low many a good
    buck, the powder-flask, primer, and ball-bag were ready for August;
    the ivy was carefully trained up the windows inside; and the ale-bowls
    and tankards were about the room. It was quite a Norwegian homestead.
    One thing was unusual&mdash;a musical instrument called a <i>psalmodicum</i>,
    which is a board painted green with red flowers, about an inch thick
    and thirty inches long, with three strings raised on a bridge like a
    violin. These strings are played with a bow, also of the violin class,
    but different in character. We regretted very much that we could not
    persuade any one to perform upon it.</p>

  <p>On our return we found the proposed trip emanated from the fact that
    a house-painter was going over to Eikesdal, and had been waiting for
    clear weather to carry out his object. By the next morning a farmer
    from Eikesdal proposed joining us: he knew the way. This completed
    our party, and at four o’clock we started, with every assurance of
    fine weather. Working up through the stunted birch-trees, we soon
    looked over the heights of the Vermer Fos to Storhættan. The Svart-hø
    rose behind us, and approaching the snow-line, we came upon the
    reindeer-flower (<i>Ranunculus glacialis</i>), with its sharp-pointed leaves
    and beautiful white blossom. Then the dreary Gravendal opened to us,
    wild, bleak, weird, and barren to a degree, with Amra Jura on our
    right, directly over Eikesdal, far, far away. About this time there was
    a grand solar rainbow. We now got very rough rock-tramping&mdash;regular
    <i>couloir</i> climbing&mdash;and there was no <span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>vegetation, the moss being of the
    “crottle” tribe, a perfectly black lichen. As we ascended the peaks
    were grander. Many reindeer <i>spör</i> were seen, but no reindeer. At the
    highest part we found the snow discoloured by a very fine dark gritty
    dust; and it is a remarkable fact that this discoloration was the
    result of volcanic eruption in Iceland. After the eruption a gale set
    in from the W.S.W., which on Easter Monday, 1875, positively carried
    the clouds of scoriæ right across Norway. The line was followed even to
    Sweden, and corroborated by some peasants who were out when it fell.</p>

  <p>A volcanic eruption in Iceland is a serious matter. One of the worst
    occurred in 1783. On that occasion 14,000 persons were killed. In the
    eruption of 1875, the vegetation, which provided for 40,000 sheep,
    2,000 cattle, and 3,000 horses, was all destroyed. The hay harvest, the
    only one in Iceland, was also entirely destroyed. Scoriæ, varying from
    fine pumice to pieces the size of two fists, covered its surface from
    an inch and a half to eight inches deep. The eruption began about nine
    <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and when the scoriæ fell there was total darkness. The
    air was so highly charged with electricity that staff-spikes held up in
    the hand seemed to be in a blaze.</p>

  <p>We soon began to descend a little to a vast plateau. Our provisions had
    been fallen back upon every few hours, and were now much reduced. The
    farmer looked forward to the plateau as being likely to afford some
    <i>multebær</i>, a kind of raspberry with a hard skin, but juicy. A good and
    most useful man was the farmer. Favoured by the weather, he steered
    well, and we soon came to an incline on the snow, where we could make
    a long and safe <i>glissade</i>. It was certainly a novelty to see us all
    flying down. The farmer was the best man, and happily we reached the
    bottom in safety. Another hour and we lay down to rest and enjoy our
    <i>multebær</i>. They were deliciously refreshing. The house-painter, or
    <i>maler</i>, suggested that there was a <i>sæter</i> somewhere at the head of
    Eikesdal which we might try for. “That is just what we are making
    for,” said our cheery chief, the farmer; “in about an hour we shall be
    there.” On we went, our fatigue being forgotten in the grandeur of the
    scenery and the difficulty of picking one’s way, for hopping from stone
    to stone absorbs the attention considerably. The time soon passed,
    and after we had completed our twelve hours’ walk <span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>we had arrived at
    some weather-worn, storm-riven, dwarfed, gnarled, and twisted birches,
    beyond which, in a <i>botten</i>, lay our <i>sæter</i>. What an invasion! The
    two girls were astonished, but when they heard the voice of the farmer
    all was well. Ole immediately ordered a <em>bunker</em>, as it is called
    in Romsdal; in Gudbransdalen it is termed <i>rummer coller</i>. How we
    enjoyed our rest after this simple food! A <em>bunker</em>, however, should
    be described: it is a flat wooden tub of curds and whey, and is handed
    to two people. Each person is armed with a spoon, with which it is
    etiquette to draw a line across the centre for your <i>vis-à-vis</i> to eat
    up to, not beyond; but few Englishmen ever reach the line unless they
    are very old hands.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>Reeb Holder.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>We were now at the head of the Eikesdal gorge, or valley; a roaring
    torrent rushed down the centre to Utigaard; on the left were
    steep precipices with a large fall; while the opposite side was
    perpendicular, and threatened showers of troll stones. As we descended
    we saw many huge masses of rocks which had ploughed their way down,
    carrying all before them. To see one of these <i>lapsus naturæ</i> is a very
    impressive sight, and makes one hold his breath and think. Passing
    through the valley, we noticed some very curious snow shoes, in form
    like the square frames on which sea-lines are wound, but with broader
    cross-pieces. Birch twigs on each side and over the foot fix them. On
    we trudged, having bidden farewell to the farmer, thanked him for his
    good services, and had a <i>skaal</i> for Gamle Norge. Finally, we left the
    house-painter at his destination, where the old lady told us all about
    the dust coming down upon her; and then Ole and myself were alone to
    finish the day. We had started at four <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and it was now
    ten <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> We at length saw the spire of a church&mdash;the kirk at
    Utigaard&mdash;and we began to inquire for Torstin Utigaard of Utigaard, the
    hunter. At last we found his house, but he was on the fjeld. Could we
    get a bed anywhere? No, nothing. Ole persevered, and we presently found
    comfort. Torstin was expected down from the fjeld that night with
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>an
    English gentleman, whose servant most kindly gave me his bed. After
    awhile down they came. Enter Torstin, a grand-looking fellow, drenched.
    They had killed a <i>semle ku</i>, and had left two men behind to bring it
    down next day. In the morning they arrived with it, forming the wildest
    reunion of hunters. The Finmark dog, quite black, looked a beauty as
    he lay by the dead reindeer. “Blenk”&mdash;for such was his name&mdash;was a
    good and trusty servant: neither biped nor quadruped would venture to
    interfere with him when he was on duty. It was a splendid group, worthy
    of the pencil of a Landseer.</p>

  <p>After the pouring rain of the previous evening, which had continued
    through the night, we all had hopes of fine weather for our trip,
    and still more did we desire to see, before leaving, Utigaard in the
    beauty of sunshine. But no; on arising at about five, we found dirtier
    weather than ever; the mist low down; Blenk still keeping watch by the
    reindeer which had been brought down; every kind of waterproof oilskin
    being looked out; and a great demand for sou’-westers. At last the
    <i>stolkjær</i> was packed, and everything ready to go down to the boats.
    The baggage on the <i>stolkjær</i> was surmounted by a reindeer head, Blenk
    ever in attendance, and Torstin Utigaard of Utigaard leading the pony
    as our chief. Then we were off, looking something between fishermen and
    smugglers.</p>

  <p>It was with much regret we took our last look at Utigaard as we settled
    down in the boats <i>en route</i> for Syltebø. The valley was grand in
    the extreme, the mist sometimes breaking up over the sky-line with a
    sudden rush, as if thankful to get loose and range over the fjeld with
    freedom. Hardly were we under way, and the crew settled down to the
    steady-going pace which Norwegians can keep up for any length of time,
    when Utigaard burst out wondering who could have been the figures he
    telescoped on the snow on the previous day&mdash;the fellows who had nearly
    spoilt their sport and frightened their deer at the very moment when
    they thought they had the “rein” well in hand. What could people be
    doing up there? why should they go? who had ever seen any one in that
    part of the fjeld? At last the thought flashed across his mind that it
    might have been us. Was it? Yes, most undoubtedly it was, but happily
    we had unintentionally turned the deer; it was, however, the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
    way, so no harm had been done. The deer had been bagged, and we now all
    rejoiced together.</p>

  </div>

  <p>As the three boats rowed steadily in solemn procession down the <i>vand</i>
    we approached the Vika Pass on the starboard side. At this point the
    lake is most imposing, its grandeur much enhanced by the mist, which
    is ever changing, ever beautiful in form and intensity. Soon some of
    the favourite old Norwegian songs were started, the chorus being echoed
    by the other boats. On the opposite side of the Vika Pass there had
    been a great <i>steen-skreed</i>; and so immense are the surroundings that
    it was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>impossible to realise the extent of the devastation until
    we approached the base of it, as it had dashed and lumbered into the
    lake; then the huge masses revealed themselves in their unmistakable
    proportions, dwarfing our boats to mere insignificant specks by their
    side.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Near this spot bears have been seen, and one was tracked only lately.
    This led to the subject of bear-traps and “self-shooters,” when the
    Tentmaster-general enlarged on the <i>modus operandi</i> adopted by the
    postmaster at Sundal. He knew there were bears, and having fully
    studied the spot, determined to lay a “self-shooter,” if possible, or
    at all events a trap; and this he very ingeniously so arranged that
    when the trap caught Master Bruin a red flag should go up: this he
    could see with a telescope from the post-office as he sat sorting the
    letters. Some people had noticed that the latter operation took much
    longer than usual about this time; still no one attributed the delay to
    the postmaster’s love of bear-hunting, and they little thought that he
    sorted with one eye and watched for Bruin with the other. At last one
    day the postmaster saw the red flag. This was too much; the letter eye
    immediately joined the fun. He was off at once to the bear, shot him,
    and brought him home; and during the year he managed to get four.</p>

  <p>Hard as it rained, we were very sorry when our boat trip drew to a
    close, and we felt that we should soon have to bid farewell to Torstin
    and Eikesdal Lake, with its many joys, rough life, and hearty welcomes.
    We had a glorious walk from the lake to Syltebø, and were glad when
    we saw in the distance the white house which was to be our haven of
    rest, and to welcome us as friends. Soon after our arrival our host
    came in from the river with a good fish; and many a one has been taken
    from that stream, in spite of the change which has come over Norwegian
    rivers within the last few years. When English sportsmen began fishing
    in Norway the <i>bönder</i> attached no value to salmon. They were surprised
    to see them caught with such slight rods and tackle; but, as soon as it
    dawned upon them that salmon were worth so much per pound, they began
    to help themselves by netting them at the mouth of the river, before
    they could ascend the stream which the enthusiastic Piscator had <span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>paid
    a good sum to rent. The natural consequence is that Norwegian rivers do
    not afford the sport they once did.</p>

  <p>Whilst shooting at Syltebø, one of my friends found a beautiful
    specimen of amethystic crystal of considerable size. From here a
    steamer runs to Molde, one of the northern sea-coast centres, and true
    to its time the little screw came off the landing-place with hardly
    any one on board, for the season was far advanced: most tourists and
    sportsmen had returned, and we enjoyed it all the more, as it afforded
    us a better opportunity of seeing the people themselves.</p>

  <p>The variety in Norwegian travel adds greatly to one’s enjoyment. In
    the present trip we started from a rich expansive valley; thence
    we ascended through woods of birch and alder by a torrent’s side,
    vegetation became stunted and sparse, mosses gradually disappeared,
    and lichens preponderated; then came barren boulders, and, above all,
    the everlasting snow. Having attained this, our journey was varied
    by a descent to the wild gorge of Utigaard; the Lake of Eikesdal, a
    vast body of water, with its grand fall; then again, after the boating
    procession, through the valley of Syltebø, by the side of its salmon
    river, to the sea; and finally we were on the deck of the bustling
    little screw steamer. On stopping at the first place we were surprised
    to see a large boat coming off, mushroomed with huge umbrellas, whence
    issued the music of Norwegian voices, and evidently those of ladies;
    but as they neared the steamer the soft strains ceased, and they
    came alongside in silence. Our array of oilskins, waterproofs, and
    sou’-westers announced that foreigners were on board. We, however,
    considered that this treasure trove should not be a dead letter on
    a rainy day, and the Patriarch broached the subject of Norwegian
    music, which happily led to an encore of all the boat songs and
    many others, reinforced with much gusto by the chorus of oilskins,
    waterproofs, and sou’-westers. They were a happy band&mdash;all ladies and
    no gentlemen&mdash;going to a party at the <i>præstegaard</i>, some few miles
    down the fjord. They assured us the priest would be very pleased to
    see us, and give us a hearty welcome. It was with much regret we were
    compelled to decline the invitation, especially as it would have
    afforded a pleasing episode in our trip, and given us an opportunity
    of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>seeing the <i>vie intime</i> of a Norwegian minister’s home <i>en fête</i>.
    As their boat left the steamer, they sang one of our favourite songs,
    and our modest chorus followed it at a gradually increasing distance
    until both faded away. After this cheerful but soaking morning we
    comforted ourselves with stories of the fjeld, salmon, and Norwegian
    life. Happily the Tentmaster-general was in great force, and, when
    called upon for a yarn, responded with “muckle hilarity,” giving us one
    of his reindeer experiences. Can we do better than repeat it here?</p>

  </div>

  <p>First scene, <i>tente abri</i> on the fjeld. Snow close above; in fact,
    too much snow for sport. The Tentmaster-general telescoping alone in
    the camp, if one may so call two tents. Having had a very hard and
    weary stalk on the previous day, he was resting whilst the Major and
    Dan went up after deer. Soon after they had settled down to work, the
    Finmark dog “Passop” became very uneasy, and so fretted the string by
    which he was led that Dan thought he might break away, which would be
    sudden destruction to everything; he therefore carried the dog in his
    arms. Shortly afterwards, Dan, doubtlessly becoming slightly tired of
    carrying the dog, relaxed his hold a little. At that moment Passop
    caught sight of a buck, sprang from Dan’s arms, and bolted after the
    deer. Dan threw up his arms in despair, and gave vent to several
    Norwegian hunting quotations unfavourable to Passop’s future happiness.
    One thing was certain&mdash;the dog would go till he died from sheer
    exhaustion, and Dan would never recover his favourite Finmarker. Dan
    soliloquised, and watched long with his telescope, and finally gave way
    to grief. The next few hours were very blank and sad&mdash;deer and Passop
    both gone. In the afternoon, with melancholy thoughts and sluggish
    conversation, they began retracing their steps to the camp, which
    was about six miles distant. As soon as they were in sight of their
    fjeld home the Tentmaster-general came cheerfully to meet them, for he
    had seen seven deer steadily going down to a lake, and had anxiously
    awaited the return of Passop. No time, however, was to be lost. Off he
    went in pursuit alone, with the Major’s rifle. Hardly had he got away
    from the camp when he caught a glimpse of more deer&mdash;two this time,
    both going to the edge. He lay down to watch them, for patience as well
    as judgment <span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>is required in reindeer work. After some time a strange
    sound, like the bark of a dog, came down; but who ever heard the bark
    of a dog in the wilds of the fjeld and on the snow? Listening again, in
    a few minutes, from behind a huge boulder, came a <i>stor buck</i> straight
    on, with a dog close behind. What a chance! Happily the Tentmaster was
    equal to the occasion. In the twinkling of an eye the shot was fired,
    the buck was hit, but carried his bullet with him, and made for the
    water. The dog gaining on him a little, he dashed into the water to
    swim for it; but Passop dashed in too, for by this time our hunter had
    recovered from his astonishment at the strange dog, and recognised it
    as Passop. The ice-water of these lakes is, of course, intensely, cold,
    and the dog was obliged to come back: he, however, did not do so until
    he had had a good tug at the deer, which by this time had turned on his
    side and was dead. A second time Passop tried to reach him, and was
    obliged to return; but the third time he got on his back, and sitting
    there, held the horns in his teeth. As the dog could not bring him
    ashore, what was to be done? By this time the Major had come up, and
    determined to swim for him, and tow him on shore. The ice-water was too
    cold for him also, and he was obliged to turn back. The deer was too
    far out to lasso, even could they lead the line up from the camp. But
    <i>nil desperandum</i>. Hardly had their wondering got full swing when a
    tremendous squall swept down the hillside, caught the deer and Passop,
    and they drifted in. The Major made another attempt, and the deer was
    landed. They were soon off to the camp, where Dan, with a very sad
    heart, was preparing <i>speise</i>. When the latter looked up and saw them
    coming, accompanied by his beloved dog, his expression soon changed,
    and Passop was caught up into his arms as quickly as he had sprung
    from them in the morning, while Dan, with a radiant face and his head
    a little on one side, turning round to the Tentmaster-general, said,
    “Good man, Maget good man.” Passop was made much of, Dan’s happiness
    restored, and the one bottle of champagne was iced in the snow, to
    drink to “Rensdyr jagt paa hoie fjeld.” It was a great day happily
    terminated, and long to be remembered.</p>

  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img illow20"><img src="images/i_175.jpg" alt="F" /></span>OR
    some days we had been on the tramp, and arrived
    at Indfjord. Thursday, August 20th, 1875, was a sad day there. Returned
    from a long tour through very wild, rough districts, where neither food
    nor lodgings were to be had, we were settling down for a good night’s
    rest, certainly under difficulties, at the house of a good farmer named
    Ole Erikson Boe, when the gruesome news came of a disaster in the
    mountains above. A tremendous rock crash, or <i>steen-skreed</i>, had taken
    place at a spot called Sylbotten, some three thousand feet above, where
    there were two <i>sæters</i> occupied by two <i>piger</i>, who had charge of the
    cows belonging to the good people down the valley. We started off at
    once. In a more than quiet spot like this, with what a crash does such
    news burst upon every one! What sympathy it brings out; what interest
    in the details of the occurrence! What sadness marks each face, and how
    quiet and subdued all are, though all are talking!</p>

  <p>We pass on, with a little provision in our wallets, and soon come to
    some reapers in the valley, working in the fields, with leather aprons
    for their protection. We started with Halve Jacobsen, the owner of
    the <i>sæter</i>, who went up, taking a pony and foal, in case the mare’s
    services were required: the foal always runs by the mother. On our sad
    mission we could not be otherwise than struck with the joyfulness of
    this young animal, its abounding spirits, caprioles, and quirks and
    capers. Before arriving at the steep part of the ascent we stopped at
    a small outbuilding close to the farm, the front of the house looking
    over the Indfjord, with a grand expanse before one, the morning light
    shimmering down to the edge of the water far, far below, and all
    seeming peace and gladness. At the back of the house, between that and
    the <i>laave</i>, we found a vastly different scene&mdash;pain, grief, and heavy
    hearts. What a contrast to the brightness on the fjord side&mdash;the sunny
    side that was! The anxious group was in shadow, comparatively speaking,
    the centre attraction being a roughly made stretcher, on which was
    lying, hardly conscious, pale,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
    agonized, and bone-broken, Ingeborg,
    Erichsdatter, Griseth. Poor girl! she had been brought down some three
    thousand feet by a very steep <i>sæter</i> path&mdash;for there was hardly any
    road&mdash;jogged and shaken, with one leg broken, ribs crushed, and her
    face much cut and bruised by the cracking up of the <i>sæter</i> before the
    overwhelming force which carried it away. Around her were the <i>bönder</i>
    folk, and one poor old woman whose grief seemed beyond consolation.
    The autumn was advanced, and the winter coming quickly on, for the
    first snow days had begun. She had only one cow to support her: that
    was at Sjolbotten, and was killed, so her only hope of livelihood was
    for the moment swept from her, as no cow could be got under £5, and
    “no siller had she.” What a chance for some rich Samaritan to heal a
    broken heart for the small sum of £5!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
    But as “many a mickle makes a
    muckle,” so, doubtless, would a new cow be bought by the kindly spirits
    of the good Indfjord folk. Their love for each other is a lesson to
    even the most civilised among us. Indeed, it is very noticeable that
    small communities care for everybody, while large masses notice no
    individual&mdash;only charitable institutions.</p>

    <img class="w100" src="images/i_176.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>Looking across Indfjord.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>But we have not yet commenced the ascent. The mare leads through the
    brushwood, the cheerful foal diverging now and then in the self-conceit
    of all young things, fancying they know better than their mothers. It
    was a steep climb. The mare slipped; but Halve said it was all right,
    she knew the way. The morning was warm, and, as soon as we arrived
    at a kind of ledge looking over the valley and fjord, we halted.
    What a lovely, or rather, what a grand scene it was! Still there was
    no forgetting our <span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>mission&mdash;no shaking off its sadness. Our present
    object, after Ingeborg’s arrival, was to go up and see after her
    companion, Ingrana. Our halt was not for long. We had already taken off
    our coats, and hung them on a pine-stump. To our surprise, Halve left
    his there until our return, and said, when we did not, “You can leave
    anything as you like in Gamle Norge.”</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow70" id="i_177">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_177.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>The Halt at Griseth.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p><i>En route</i>, in three hours we had left our last brier and alder behind,
    and were on the plateau of the High Fjeld, and found much <i>smörgrass</i>,
    so good for cows. As <i>smör</i> is the Norse for butter, it will explain
    the name. For a long time we tramped over the <i>botten</i>, carpeted with
    rich flora; but at the end we saw the <i>steen-skreed</i>, or landslip. Some
    four or five <i>bönder</i> were already there, and seemed very surprised
    to see a foreigner coming up with Halve. A few words of explanation,
    and all was understood: one common object in view, that of helping
    each other, soon bound us together. Ingrana naturally had not been to
    sleep since the disaster. It is difficult to imagine any Norske <i>pige</i>
    nervous, but poor Ingrana had been shaken and frightened out of her
    wits. Her description, after a little entreaty and patience on the
    part of the persuader, ran thus:&mdash;Early in the morning Ingrana was
    awakened by a heavy rolling sound of thunder, followed directly by a
    crash. She rushed from her <i>sæter</i>, and, coming out of her door, saw
    Ingeborg’s <i>sæter</i> carried away and buried. It is difficult to realise
    the feelings of this simple-minded girl, living so solitary a life for
    three months. In a moment&mdash;a second of time&mdash;one was taken and the
    other left. Ten cows also were buried; and, no help being at hand,
    Ingrana had to go down this lonely mountain with the sad news, leaving
    her companion fixed, pinned, and crushed until she could return with
    assistance.</p>

  <p>We arrived after three and a half hours’ hard ascent, when some sour
    milk that had been left was given us. The Englishman elicited a smile
    from Ingrana when, taking the bowl from his lips, his moustache was
    white with cream. This was hopeful and a good sign.</p>

  <p>The slip was accelerated by a very large waterspout striking the face
    of the mountain, as amongst the rocks which were brought down was a
    quantity of sand, and the presence and action of water were palpable,
    deep <span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>pools being left in many places. The scene was appalling&mdash;a
    wreck in the wildest sense of the word. Some three-quarters of a mile
    of mountain side had come down, carrying all before it&mdash;<i>rammeding</i>,
    as the Norse word is. Huge rocks, a few stunted trees, hardly any kind
    of herbage&mdash;what a hurly-burly of desolation! Looking across and over
    it, we saw the distant placid fjord and open sea. What a contrast, the
    peace of one and the turbulence of the other! Still the damage was a
    known quantity, every year something of the kind happening, sometimes
    with loss of life, sometimes without. The accompanying sketch was taken
    from the lower portion, looking upwards.</p>

  </div>

  <p>After going over the greater part of this chaos we went back to the
    preserved <i>sæter</i>, where we were most kindly received, our sympathy
    being accepted in the same spirit in which it was offered. Then we
    returned. We found Halve’s coat quite safe and undisturbed, and after
    the usual time arrived at Ole Erikson Boe’s farm, where we had a simple
    repast of good <i>fladbrod</i> and <i>bunker</i>, there being no meat here. We
    rested, and early in the morning started for Fiva. During the evening
    Boe showed me an old Danske Bible, folio size, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1590, with
    large brass clasps. The good folk wanted me to bring my wife to the
    funeral, in case the poor girl should not survive. In the morning we
    went down to the shore, as we heard the steamer for Molde was coming
    in to take Ingeborg thither, should she be still alive. Life was all
    but extinct when she was got on board. Ole Fiva and myself started in
    a boat for Veblungsnæs, having thanked the good people of Indfjord
    for their kind welcome, and they expressing their gratitude for our
    interest and sympathy, and reiterating their desire to welcome my wife
    at Indfjord.</p>

  <p>The morning was lovely for boat travel; such peace that convulsions
    like those we had witnessed seemed incredible. But it was no dream: the
    inhabitants of Indfjord, the family of Ingeborg, Ingrana, and the poor
    woman without her solitary cow, all were stern realities.</p>

  <p>Soon after our return to Fiva we heard that Ingeborg was dead, had
    been taken back from Molde, and was to be buried in the <i>gravested</i>
    at Indfjord on September 2nd, 1875. Accordingly, early that morning
    we started in carrioles from Fiva to Veblungsnæs, where myself, wife,
    daughter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
    and Ole Fiva took a boat with six oars for Indfjord. A
    lovely, peaceful morning it was as we left the landing-place at
    Veblungsnæs. Soon the six oars began their sturdy dip as we came under
    the shadow of the mountains: the dip was strong, as Norwegians only
    can row for a long travelling sweep and perfect time. After settling
    down with our <i>tine</i> of provisions&mdash;for we were travelling Norskily,
    and no Norske is complete without a well-filled <i>tine</i>&mdash;a sad tone
    seemed pervading the boat: our mission was one of sympathy for the
    bereavement of others, with an after-thought of thankfulness that
    we had been spared in health, and were sound in body and bone. But
    the melancholy of every one was broken by a remark from Ole that we
    should soon see the Runic <i>steen</i>, which is about half a Norske mile
    from Veblungsnæs. A lieutenant of engineers, who was superintending
    a new bridge, had described this stone to us, and we were eager to
    see it. At last we came upon it. The boatman ran alongside, and threw
    water over it to develop it. In nine hundred years pluvial attrition
    alone is sure to make its mark, to say nothing of our energetic friend
    Neptune’s constant stormdrift and tempest. (The writer would apologize
    for the term “pluvial attrition,” but there are so many long words
    about just now, what with street advertisements and urban authors.) A
    general view of the Runic stone is given in the opposite engraving,
    while the initial ornament on <a href="#Page_175">page 175</a> was drawn from a plant plucked
    on the spot. The letters are thirteen in number, and their length about
    eighteen inches. Twelve feet from the sea-level, under low-water mark,
    and projecting some few feet, runs a ledge of rocks, beneath which is
    supposed to be secreted untold wealth.</p>

  <p>The translation of these Runic hieroglyphics is, “The Court of
    Justice,” and this inscription was evidently placed in a conspicuous
    position to guide any who came to the court in old pagan days; for
    Romsdal was one of the last of the pagan strongholds. Above, high up,
    close to Sylbotten, was a pagan temple; but the Court of Justice was
    held at Devold, Romsdal.</p>

  <p>There was now a regular good settle down for a long pull. Up to this
    time we have been in shadow, but now we round a point, and taking what
    a landsman would call the “first on the left,” we go due south down to
    Indfjord. The sea-water is beautifully clear, reflecting the quartz
    rocks. <i>à merveille</i>, like the good old chandeliers of our grandfathers
    after a spring <span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>cleaning; the rich sunlit yellow seaweed is grander
    far than ormolu; and here are three herons in repose, water-ousels with
    their snow-white breasts, and now and then sparkles by an old cormorant
    or diver. As we go down the fjord the snow range at the end of it
    blocks in everything, the morning mist waiting in the valley for exit,
    if possible.</p>

  </div>

  <p>By this time we near the hamlet, and high above us on the left, on a
    kind of plateau, we see many figures congregated. They were in front of
    Erich’s house, Griseth being the name of the farm. We soon steered in,
    and then between two boathouses, at a rude pile-driven landing-place,
    the well-known scrape of keel on shore was heard, and we had safely
    arrived at Indfjord. Griseth had sent down to meet us and invite us
    up to the house, but we return the message that we would rather not
    disturb the family, but await their arrival at the <i>gravested</i>; so,
    with our <i>tine</i>, we picked out a spot for lunch, and enjoyed some
    cold reindeer meat, biscuit, cheese, &amp;c. During lunch we could see
    the <i>bönder</i> folk collecting high up at Griseth, overlooking the
    fjord, and at two o’clock we saw them by the telescope start down the
    narrow mountain path, the coffin being lashed on to the little cart to
    prevent it slipping. Soon they were lost in a dip of the wood, from
    which they emerged nearer to us. As we stood at the <i>gravested</i>, or
    graveplace&mdash;like our word homestead, home-place&mdash;a man came up and
    shook hands with us, and then standing on the wall, commenced tolling
    the bell; for there is no church, but only a bell-tower.</p>

  <p>Soon the procession drew near. First came the coffin, black, lashed on
    to the hay-cart, and drawn by a beautiful young <i>blakken</i>, or Norske
    pony, whose collar was of old carved wood painted, the <i>bonde</i> driver
    walking behind the coffin, which bore three wreaths of wild flowers. At
    a distance behind the coffin followed the men, and after an interval
    the sorrowing women, who were succeeded by men of the family, many
    sad hearts, and Ingrana. It was a modest but impressive scene. When
    the pony arrived at the <i>gravested</i>, hearing the tolling bell, he
    shied and jibbed, as if regretting what he had done. The coffin was
    therefore carried in at once. There being no clergyman, a friend sang
    a hymn. The coffin was lowered into the grave; the wreaths removed;
    the ropes withdrawn. Some one said to Ingrana, “You were lucky to
    escape.” “I could not have been <span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>ready,” she said; “God wanted me not,
    and left me a little longer. She was ready,” meaning Ingeborg, whom
    they were burying. They then sang the second hymn, “Hjemme, Hjemme,”
    as the friends shovelled the earth in, and the heavy thud of the large
    spadeful boomed like parts of Handel’s “Dead March” in <i>Saul</i>. After
    filling in the grave the wreaths were placed on the newly raised mound,
    and the ceremony closed with “Hjemme.” The weird sea birds screamed,
    and all went away together. Many will recount the story of Ingeborg,
    Erichsdatter, Griseth.</p>

  <p>Before leaving the <i>gravested</i> the grave-boards must be noted, they
    being so remarkable in form, so quaint, and also so Bosphoric.
    Sometimes a white butterfly is introduced, as typical of the soul.
    How different from the present association with the allegory of their
    transient nothingness! After the funeral we had to pay two or three
    visits. All the farmers wanted us to visit them&mdash;some to tell of
    sport, others to offer us <i>aqua vitæ</i> and stamped cakes like the Dutch
    <i>waffles</i>; and when we returned to Ole Erikson Boe’s he gave me an old
    Norske belt as a memento of our visit, which we need hardly say is most
    carefully treasured.</p>

  <p>So passed away Ingeborg, Erichsdatter of Griseth, while Ingrana
    remained waiting her bidding.</p>

    <span class="drop-img illow20"><img src="images/i_182.jpg" alt="I" /></span>STERDAL
    is full of interest and character, with
    a wild river, precipitous mountains on either side, snow on the high
    peaks above, a rushing of waters below, hardly any track, and shut in
    by a façade of rock at the end of the valley; and yet it is the way
    from Romsdal to Valdal. Let us, therefore, explore it, and do so in
    two fyttes&mdash;a short carriole ride to the <i>sæter</i> with the ladies, and
    beyond, high, high up, for real research without the ladies.</p>

  <p><i>Place aux dames.</i> We tried the short journey with two carrioles, and
    for an English mile or two we did pretty well, as they will go anywhere
    and over anything; but as we got into the scrubwood and underwood the
    road grew worse, the wheels going sometimes over a boulder one or two
    feet in height, the axle assuming an alarming angle, and the <i>skyd-gut</i>
    hanging on <span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>the high side to keep the vehicle from turning over&mdash;first
    one side and then the other&mdash;till the fair occupants of the machine
    were shaken to a jelly, and would fain try to walk. Still we all
    persevere, and soon arrive at the meal-mill, given in the accompanying
    page illustration. What a retired spot for business! Who would ever
    think of it as a centre to draw customers and found a business&mdash;as
    a likely spot for a man beginning with the conventional half-crown
    becoming the architect of his own fortune?</p>

  <p>The water seen here is the Ister&mdash;ever thick and muddy, and always in
    violent motion. What a contrast to the calm dignity of the adjacent
    mountains in all their graduated phases! A little above this is a shoot
    which brings down water to turn the mill. On our arrival the miller
    comes out with a quiet kind of welcome, and very kindly shows us the
    stones doing their share of work to bring about <i>fladbrod</i> for the
    people of the valley during their summer visit: it is for the <i>sæter</i>
    people they work principally.</p>

  <p>Leaving the mill, we pass on to the denser scrub and brushwood. We had
    with us an old Skye terrier, full of noble traits of character&mdash;courage
    and endurance&mdash;but being as blind as Belisarius, and running against
    some of the rocks in the track, he was not only thrown on his haunches,
    but his nerve was shaken&mdash;that Highland nerve which is of such rare
    stuff. Let us immortalise our blind Norwegian canine traveller by a
    description. If lost, an advertisement should run thus:&mdash;“Lost, a
    brindled Skye terrier, answering to the name of ‘Kyle.’ Rough broken
    hair, broad chest, short-legged, bow-legged, middle-aged and strong,
    and carries his tail high. True to the core, with a head as large as a
    deerhound’s. Teeth to match.” The Norwegians at first thought it would
    be well to shoot him, but when they came to know him better he soon
    enlisted them all among his many ardent admirers.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the idea may flit across the mind of some, Why bring a blind
    Scotch terrier into a work on Norway? This is why: old Kyle was taken
    that day for a young bear by a simple-minded Norwegian cow. Never were
    fear and fright more vividly portrayed than by the action of that
    animal, and of her tail especially, on the first glimpse of the brown
    brindled terrier. Hearing his name mentioned, he has just wagged his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
    tail, which is quite flat, like an otter’s, and when very pleased he
    wags it with the flat side on to the floor to produce more sound.</p>

  <p>By this time we are at the <i>sæter</i>, where the <i>piger</i> have come to look
    after the cows until September. Having driven on to the only flat piece
    of grass, we unpack for lunch, when the produce of the aforesaid cows
    comes to our comfort in an unadulterated form, and thoroughly is the
    simple fare enjoyed. After lunch we visit the interior of the <i>sæter</i>,
    and find spinning going on steadily, a little national tune being
    hummed to the whirring wheel accompaniment. The weaving is done during
    the winter months. In the summer a little spinning is done, but only by
    the most industrious.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow100" id="i_184">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_184.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>Spinning in the Sæter: Isterdal.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>To see Isterdal the only way is to walk. Let us, therefore, continue
    on from the <i>sæter</i> in the direction of the Valdal. This was done
    with Ole Fiva. Soon we began to ascend, for the end of the valley is
    precipitous, with a fine fall, the top of which must be reached before
    arriving at the plateau, <i>botten</i>, or <i>balloch</i>. On commencing the
    ascent Ole pointed out in the river below a spot where a bear had been
    killed; and higher up <span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>again where a bear lived, for he had seen it
    there. Some idea of the situation is given by the opposite woodcut,
    with the <i>aiguilles</i> on the right. This is looking down Isterdal. The
    path was effaced the day before we passed by the descent of a quantity
    of rough stuff, more than sufficient to have carried us with it into
    the valley beneath. The <i>aiguilles</i> are of a similar formation to the
    Troltinderne in Romsdal, and seem to be a nursery of trolds for future
    ages.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow72" id="i_185f">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_185f.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>The Head of the Valley: Isterdal.</i></div>
    <div class="larger-version">[<a href="images/i_185f_big.jpg">See larger version</a>]</div>
  </div>

  <p>The evening glows on these pinnacles are marvellously and beautifully
    grand, and the transitions of hue from one to the other beyond
    imagination and conception. Still we work up. Ole, ignoring the
    slightly defined regular track, goes up really awful places, hauling
    himself up, and astonishing his follower and companion by displaying
    the most unnecessary and enviable agility. All honour to such strength
    and energy! By this time we had reached the plateau from which the
    murky Ister takes a header into the valley which lay at our feet. Once
    on the plateau, we could get along better over the stunted flora and
    bare rocks, with snow here and there, especially on the south-west
    side. The track is indicated by a few pieces of rock, put here and
    there in a pile, which being of the same formation as the rock we
    are walking on, the similarity of colour makes them very indistinct
    at times: the best way is to look out for one on the sky-line, if
    possible. After a long tramp we crossed the Ister again, and found
    it still more turbid, which was puzzling, as it seemed to come from
    a glacier above; but of this more anon. We worked on until we could
    look down Valdal, and having drunk in nature in that direction, took a
    little food from our wallets, and lay down for an <i>al fresco</i> siesta on
    a handsome natural carpet of <i>fjelde reis</i> and other vegetation.</p>

  <p>After that, Ole began telling of expeditions, traditions, and
    excursions to the Jager’s Steen, and formally wound up with the report
    of a frozen lake which a hunter had seen, but which had not been
    visited since. Could we find it? Was the Herr inclined to go? “Most
    certainly.” So we started.</p>

  <p>There is a wonderful sense of freedom, and yet of a closer commune with
    one’s Creator, in wandering over almost untrodden ground to admire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
    some portion of his works that have been rarely visited by man. It is
    suggestive of drawing aside the veil of the tabernacle of nature; and
    happy is the man who derives comfort and soul strength in so doing!
    Ole led straight up over rocks bare and betumbled; not a symptom of
    vegetation; above us a glacier coming to the edge of a precipice, and
    the melting ice forming a fringed fall. We lay down, looking over
    the side on a bed of scarlet and crimson <i>fjelde reis</i>, a kind of
    cotoneaster. Beyond this ledge we saw the glacier imperceptibly coming
    on, backed in the long perspective of glacial blocks by a huge bare
    mass of rock, the Biskop, and the Drönningen. This was the source of
    the Ister. The water, some distance from the foot of the fall, passed
    over a soft deposit, which sullied its pristine purity right down
    to the sea, the “murky Ister,” thus acquiring near its origin its
    characteristic turbidity.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow100" id="i_186" >
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_186.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>Melting Glacier over Valdal.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>Now for a try for the unknown lake. Ole keeps on, thinking he has his
    bearings all right. At last, having climbed up by the side of a fall
    dashing down through bare rocks, came the summit, and creeping round a
    boulder, before us lies a lake intensely deep in colour, and full of
    icebergs and floes <span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>of old ice. Where we stood there was snow, with
    tracks of reindeer; but in places the former had melted, the <em>lemmings</em>
    had been there, and the reindeer-flowers were coming up. These we eat
    with <i>fladbrod og smör</i> after a time, for we could not at once settle
    down to a snack without paying a tribute of respect to the majesty of
    nature before us. Beginning our meal in earnest, in the midst of it we
    heard a noise like a roll of thunder, the direction of which we soon
    discovered. On the left side of the lake the vast expanse of snow was
    riven by a gigantic avalanche, which ploughed its way down, and, coming
    to the edge of the rocks, plunged headlong into the lake, agitating all
    the ice, and causing the icebergs to jostle each other; but both water
    and ice soon regained their equilibrium, and nature lay before us in
    solemn silence and undisturbed majesty. It can well be imagined that
    having once attained such a spot&mdash;some 5,000 feet above the sea&mdash;there
    was a desire to linger, though the day was fading, and we had five and
    a half hours’ walk home. However, “En route!” was the word. Straight
    down from bare rock to rock simply ends in no knees after a time, and
    one’s legs become something between strips of asparagus and sea-kale.
    There was, however, one thing in store: once on a fair road, we could
    make some running. It was a lovely evening: we were late, it was true,
    but, as horses go freely with their noses towards home, we both took
    to the road very kindly, and went along with a will. Ole did not talk
    much. It is the pace that kills, and after sixteen hours’ trudge with
    our provisions, he no doubt felt that he had done enough. With health
    and strength, such a day amidst grand scenery is a joy for ever.</p>

    all climes and in all stages of civilisation a wedding is an object
    of special interest, and is likely to bring forward some traits of
    national character. The bride is always the great attraction, of
    course, whether plain or old&mdash;not that any bride should ever be plain,
    however uncomely featured she may be, for on that day of all others,
    the spirit should shine through the clay, with every hope of happiness
    before her; and if there be happiness in the world, surely it must be
    when the bride becomes the better-half of him she loves. Let us, then,
    attend a Norske wedding.</p>

  <p>Weddings are not now as they used to be in the “good old days,” when
    knives and winding-sheets were a part of the programme&mdash;when grim
    rehearsals of the “Grapplers” were frequently repeated, and two
    combatants, with one belt round the two waists, grappled and struck
    until one was vanquished. No; Scandinavian ferocity is subsiding;
    they think more now of “bleeding” their foreign visitors, and the
    weddings are sobered down; but the arch-fiend of inebriation tightens
    his grip, and Norwegian weddings in the provinces are characterized by
    deep libations and their wretched consequences. Now, having noticed
    the worst feature of these Northern domestic gatherings, let us turn
    cheerily to the brighter side of them.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

  </div>

  <p>Naturally costume immensely assists a ceremony like this, and should
    the bride not have old silver enough of her own, everybody is ready
    to contribute towards the general result, and is only too glad to do
    anything in his power to add to the brightness of the occasion. In
    Norway the bride wears a silver crown, which varies a little in form
    according to date, the most modern crowns branching out all round more
    than the older ones. The silver crowns are generally made with hinges,
    four or six in number, so that they may fold up into a small space for
    carrying in a <i>tine</i>, or box. The oldest forms are silver-gilt; the
    more recent are partially gilt, some parts being left bright silver.
    The bride also wears a thick curb chain, with a medal, which is
    sometimes set in filigree-work; but in the case under notice the medal
    was one cast with a fine bust of Nelson. Tidemand, the Norwegian genre
    painter, has portrayed many scenes of the “Bride preparing to start,”
    “Dressing the Bride,” &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The procession to the church is generally all-important. First comes
    the fiddler, next the <i>kander</i> or tankard man, then best man, bride and
    bridegroom, fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, friends, relations,
    and many others&mdash;all the children of the place swarming round the
    church door. We should observe that there is a stolid immobility about
    some of the Norwegian <i>piger</i> which seems to become intensified on
    these occasions; but when they do melt there must be a great overflow
    of spirit and reaction.</p>

  <p>The picturesque group at the altar of the church takes one back to the
    Middle Ages: the bride resplendent in costume&mdash;in some cases quaint
    to a degree, especially in Sætersdalen&mdash;with the old silver brooches,
    rings, and pendants of generations long gathered to their fathers;
    the bridegroom also, most likely, in costume, with his best man close
    by to look after the bridesmaid; in the centre, the Elizabethan ruff,
    pure white as in Queen Elizabeth’s time, thrown vigorously up by the
    sombre black gown, renders the priest a prominent figure; while perhaps
    a ray from the sun, descending on the group, shines upon the bride
    at the very moment when that ray only <span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>is wanted to complete the
    pictorial effect of the grouping and its surroundings. The verger, or
    clerk, with his long red pole&mdash;the functionary described in a former
    chapter&mdash;is not on active service to-day to awake the sleepers; in
    fact, the congregation seems rather inclined to turn the tables and
    wake him up. The church floor is, as usual, strewn with juniper tips,
    and after the ceremony the bride and bridegroom start home. Walk, ride,
    drive, or boat&mdash;that depends on the distance and character of the road
    to be traversed. They are all picturesque: the water, however, carries
    the palm, and, as we have before remarked, the whole scene causes one
    to revert to early days, before carriages were used, or roads were
    uninviting for travel, and when locomotion was a difficulty.</p>

  </div>

  <p>What an evening it was, “the bride’s return!” As usual in Norway,
    you cannot go far without crossing a fjord: this the bride had to
    do. A twenty-oared sea-boat was her water carriage. What peace&mdash;what
    colour&mdash;what harmony! Was it typical of her future married life? A
    zephyr just filled the broad sail, the large prow rearing grandly in
    front, with a huge bunch of flowers and green things innumerable on
    the top; then a large flag and more flowers at the mast-head; and the
    rowers every now and then bursting out into a refrain, which as one
    leaves off the other takes up.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span> And how these Norsemen do row&mdash;always
    together! It is generally allowed, by men of experience in Norway,
    that so long as the rower is not too “arch-fiended” to sit up, he will
    always keep time with his oar. The dip of the oars in the calm is
    delightfully refreshing, and the regular sweep gives an idea of power.
    Fun is going on at the other end of the boat; for the bride is there
    on a raised seat, with the bridegroom, supported by their friends.
    The second boat is being left behind, so the <i>kander-man</i> is holding
    a large silver tankard to encourage and at the same time joke them.
    Doubtless a spurt will be put on after this, and another race commenced
    for the run home; or they may just stop for one more <i>skaal</i> (the
    bride’s health), and when they have once commenced, be undecided as to
    going home.</p>

  <p>One thing is a comfort, at all events; all through the country there
    is strong evidence of family affection, and these weddings are only
    the beginning of a new era of happiness. In Thelemarken, as we have
    already <span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>had occasion to remark, one custom is for the bridegroom
    to elaborately carve the <i>stabur</i>, or family treasure-house, with
    excellent designs and cunning work, which he effects with his
    tolle-knife; and another is to carve good mottoes on the large beds and
    over the doors of the rooms. The following are some from Thelemarken
    district, that quaint land of short waists, shoulder-blades, and white
    jackets&mdash;a land abounding with grand old conscientious work; huge
    timbers made into solid houses; no hurry-skurry, no slurriness, no
    giving as little as possible for wages received&mdash;real good timber-work;
    while inside may be found carved chests, some of them family treasures
    handed down for generations. Motto over bed, carved in: “This is my
    bed and resting-place, where God gives me peace and rest, that I may
    healthy arise and serve Him.” Over the entrance to a house: “Stand,
    house, in the presence of our Lord, assured from all danger, from fire
    and theft. Save it, thou, O God; bless also all who go in and all who
    go out here.” The ale-bowls, too, have good mottoes: “Of me you must
    drink; but swear not, nor ever drink too much.” This motto we would
    recommend to the licensed victuallers of England, as good for their
    “pewters.” Another drinking-bowl: “I am as a star unto you, and all
    the girls drink of me willingly.” Another: “Taste of the fruit of the
    corn-field, and thank God from your inmost heart.” This one again:
    “Drink me forthwith, and be thankful, for I shall soon be no more.”
    These, we say, are good sentiments, and worthy of note; and they must
    be the outcome of deeply rooted honest hearts, anxious to benefit not
    only those about them, but those who may follow.</p>

  </div>

  <p>When the bride returns home there are great doings, with firing of
    guns, and, as we have before observed, libations and dancing; the
    latter doing good and giving pleasure, the former, to say the least
    of them, producing the next day what is known in Scotland as the
    “blacksmith’s hammer on the forehead.”</p>

  <p>What a contrast to a Norwegian wedding, carried out with all its
    details, is the modern civilisation of being married before a
    “Registrar”&mdash;a process which must be sudden death to sentiment, and
    destructive of all the sacred associations so closely linked with the
    solemnity of marriage in Norway! Marriage takes time. The Lutheran
    Church has two distinct services or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span> ceremonies, which conduce to
    the steady-going of the young people concerned, and tend to develop
    prudent and careful living. There is first the betrothal, and then
    the wedding. Circumstances decide the particular period between the
    two events&mdash;one year generally, sometimes two or more; in any case
    the betrothal is a good preparation for the responsibilities of
    married life, and certainly works well. One thing is beyond denial&mdash;it
    affords an opportunity to discover latent objections and bad habits,
    which might not crop out all at once while the lover is offering a
    concentrated essence of courtship. By the betrothal system a girl
    enters upon a certain and marked position, being as it were an aspirant
    to the honour and dignity of marriage; and this training has generally
    a most wholesome effect. The same system is likewise carried out by the
    provincial peasants, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span> these simple folk are sometimes a little
    impatient of the second ceremony; but the law of Norway has alleviated
    any difficulty which might arise from such impetuosity, and taken the
    same <em>status</em> as that of Scotland.</p>

    <img class="w100" src="images/i_196.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><i>Before the Wedding.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>The wedding festival will frequently last a week&mdash;early and late. It is
    not “What a day we are having!” but “What a week we are having!” The
    home love of the people is prominently shown on occasions like these;
    their simple affection and general kindliness can only be the outcome
    of tenderness and sympathy in their every-day life, when the mothers
    are so motherly, the fathers so fatherly. No “iceberg dads” are to be
    found in Norway; they are more like the stoves which every one gathers
    round for comfort when the chills of life are likely to be forthcoming.
    And the priest comes out strongly on these occasions, for, as we
    have previously noticed, he is a part of every family; he shares the
    troubles of the flocks, and enhances their joys. He is no kill-joy; on
    the contrary, he enters into all that is going on, joins in the songs,
    is generally convivial at table, and is not shy of tobacco; he is, in
    fact, a practical, genial Christian, and consequently does good service
    to the cause he represents and to his flock.</p>

  <p>We now come to the last ceremonies of the Church, only remarking on
    our way the very great importance attached by the Lutheran Church to
    confirmation. In this the Church does well, and sows good seed at the
    right time&mdash;seed which is to be the joy of riper years and the backbone
    of posterity.</p>

  <p>A Norwegian funeral is surrounded by an unwholesome atmosphere of
    intense melancholy; hope and faith seem trampled down for the moment by
    the weight of present grief. The Norwegians certainly do not look upon
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>the arrival of the reaper who puts in the sickle as the “order of
    release” from the trammels of our lower state. Perhaps their intensity
    of feeling is a certain relief from which they rebound to a lighter
    burden in after-life. Their quiet, secluded life encourages this; the
    very sombreness of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>country develops it; and the almost oppressive
    grandeur of the scenery sustains it; while the absence of birds with
    joyous song certainly adds to it.</p>

  <p>Funerals in this country take many forms. First, in towns, for plump,
    portly burghers, as well as for men of note in letters, politics, or
    art, there is the old form of coffin chariot, with cock-hatted driver,
    the horses clothed in all the panoply of funereal darkness, the road
    sprinkled with juniper or yew twigs, the Death’s head blended with a
    flame rising from the urn as decoration; the latter the only cheerful,
    hopeful thought in the whole arrangement. We regret to add that, like
    weddings, funerals are characterized by heavy libations. As to military
    obsequies, they are much the same in all lands, and therefore we need
    say nothing concerning them. And now, away from towns and cemeteries,
    to the more simple method of taking farewell of passing spirits and
    lifeless clay.</p>

    <div class="caption"><i>The Stolkjær and Boat.</i></div>
  </div>

  <p>During the visit to Indfjord a description was given of the funeral of
    Ingeborg, a good <i>pige</i> swept away by a landslip. How full of sympathy
    the good folk were; how the finest breed of <i>blakken</i> was brought,
    with the best carved collar the district could produce, to honour her
    last remains! <span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>And in another place we referred to the more common
    occurrence of the coffin being placed on a <i>stolkjær</i>. During the
    winter, in some of the most inaccessible farms, such as the Geiranger,
    where there is no landing-place, the body is kept until spring.
    This seems protracted agony; but there is the balance of nature&mdash;no
    decomposition. In the less-frequented rivers a solitary boat may
    sometimes be seen, containing a funeral party unattended, their sorrow
    self-contained and unshared by others. The opposite woodcut illustrates
    a touching incident&mdash;a <i>bonde</i> and wife taking their “only one” to
    God’s acre. This is secluded life intensified. Their little one&mdash;their
    treasure and delight, their pet lamb&mdash;was called home, and they had
    to take it to its resting-place. The poor mother may have borne up
    bravely, but the sight of the churchyard in the distance was too much
    for her, and at last she gave way and sobbed over the coffin. But when
    she arrives the priest with kindly voice and deep sympathy will comfort
    and cheer her. Little, however, will they talk as they row back, with
    their hearts full and their home empty. None but those who have had an
    only one called away can realise the blank&mdash;their “sunbeam” gone. The
    grave-boards bear simple and pious inscriptions. We append a few here.</p>

  <p>The home life of Norway is very simple throughout: in summer, the
    perfect enjoyment of the short but bright season; in winter, spinning,
    weaving, and sledging. The absence of rudeness&mdash;the modern term “chaff”
    is unknown&mdash;the “even-manneredness” of the people in all classes,
    must strike a stranger. Whatever may be the class of society, there
    is always the same kindly politeness. No double set of manners, as
    civilisation brings about; no rudeness to inferiors, or fawning to
    superiors; the equal distribution of this world’s goods, combined with
    innate kindliness, prevents this. No unkindness, for they are tender
    to all dumb animals, and that is an undoubted sign of sterling worth.
    And yet, with all this, what jolly little things the children and young
    folk are! They will make the most charming little curtsey, and then go
    off, children to the core. A good innocent romp, how they enjoy it! The
    young girls, too, are so natural, perfectly easy, and well behaved,
    that it is refreshing to be with them. Nothing prim or starched about
    them, but good hearts, with the bloom of youth. Their dances, too, how
    they enjoy them; and then a song, with a chorus from the whole company,
    and another dance! Capital housewives these Scandinavian maidens should
    make, for even the <i>fröken</i>, or young girl of position, carries out all
    the household duties of home, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>enters into the real work of life
    with the greatest earnestness, being mistress of every detail, and yet
    the most charming of God’s work&mdash;a natural lady. N.B.&mdash;The Patriarch
    did not lose his heart in Gamle Norge; that was safely at home in the
    good care of one who has monopolized it ever since he was a boy.</p>

    <p>Norwegian housekeeping is so totally different from anything we
    have that it will be well to note it here. The wife has greater
    responsibility and requires more forethought than with us. There are
    no co-operative stores to which to send a long list; no one calls
    for orders, or solicits the favour of custom; no inviting circulars
    or enticing advertisements create an appetite for new purchases, and
    make one believe that superfluous things are absolutely necessary,
    and must be had. Nor does the husband go to town every day, and bring
    back anything the dear wife has forgotten. Her mental powers and good
    management must be equal to getting everything in before the winter
    arrives, not for the family only, but for the labourers also; and all
    this perhaps on slender means, sparse harvests, and bad seasons. In
    this respect, therefore, if for no other, the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>betrothal system comes
    in well, affording the young couple plenty of time for the acquisition
    of a thorough knowledge of what their new position may necessitate.</p>

  <p>There is one thing, however, Norwegians do not comprehend, and that is
    the blessing of ventilation. They cannot understand it, and certainly
    never practise it. Their rooms are stuffed up in every conceivable
    way. As soon as the cold weather begins the internal atmosphere of the
    house remains unchanged until the following summer. When you open the
    door you have to cut your way in; it is as dense as cold turtle, and
    less agreeable. The marvel is that colds are not more prevalent, from
    the fact that the good folk wash their necks on Saturday afternoon as
    a preparation for the Sunday, when they dress in their best, and look
    like different creatures.</p>

    are drawing near to the end of our tether, and
    much as we love home, there is not the same buoyancy about the return,
    however happy or successful the trip may have been, as there is about
    the start; for the latter is an important event, teeming with hope and
    expectancy, from the <i>couleur-de-rose</i> descriptions of friends who have
    preceded us, and who have heartily enjoyed the recapitulation of their
    adventures, narrow escapes, and temporary deprivations. But it is very
    different with the end of a journey. There is something of the Ichabod
    in it; and yet we know not why there should be; for if it has been one
    of danger, we ought to be thankful that it is over; and if, on the
    contrary, it has been productive of pleasant associations, we should
    still be thankful, inasmuch as it will prove a bright spot to fall back
    upon and refresh ourselves with when wearied in after-life. So we will
    not be depressed at the end of our trip to Gamle Norge; we would rather
    think of all the kindnesses of the people, the grand scenery of the
    coast, the combinations of sea-rock façade and snow, and learn a lesson
    of contentment and Christian love from the <i>bönder</i> and their happy
    families.</p>

  <p>Having overcome this very natural feeling of regret that our holiday
    is over, let us, in conclusion, notice a few leading characteristics
    of the country which have been unnoted as we passed through it. Its
    geology is most characteristic, while in variety of climate it stands
    alone. Its wood-carving, too, has great individuality; and so has its

  <p>Let us, then, take a general view of the geological formation. Any
    one specially interested in this subject should study the “Geologisk
    oversigtskart over det Sydlige Norge,” 1858 to 1865, by Theodore
    Kjerulf og Tellef Dahll; but for others a general idea will suffice.</p>

  <p>1. Gneiss predominates in the Romsdal and Sneehættan districts; also
    north and south of Sogne fjord, running down to the entrance of
    Hardanger.</p>

  <p>2. Granite predominates in the south in large areas up to the Vöring
    Fos, and in detached portions in Vestranden towards Trondhjem.
    Christiansand is granite.</p>

  <p>3. Sparagmit fjeldets (Norske) is found in Central Norway. This is
    a comglomerate of red sandstone, and sometimes called red and grey
    sparagmite.</p>

  <p>4. Trondhjem quartz in the north, really hard schist: not found south
    of the Dovre fjeld.</p>

  <p>5. Syenite and porphyry round Christiania.</p>

  <p>6. Labrador stone occurs west of Lindernæs, in the south, at Ekersund
    on the west coast, below Stavanger, round the Galdhopiggen (the highest
    point in Norway), and north-east of Fortun, in the Sogne fjord.</p>

  <p>The whole of this surface bears record of the immense extent and effect
    of the glacial period of Norway. The valleys show the glacial set as
    distinctly as does the tide in large rivers, the greatest attrition
    and scoriation being in the concaves going down. Huge bastions of
    rock<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
    have been rounded and ground down by constant attrition, and
    vast terraces of sand, at the end of each valley, are the result of
    this attrition accumulating for ages. It would be very interesting
    to analyze and find the component parts of these immense deposits.
    Certain it is there is no <span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>natural sandy soil above, and, as we have
    before mentioned, when reindeer-hunting, we have found huge boulders
    of thirty or forty feet at an elevation of 5,000 feet, with smaller
    ones of a different formation resting on them. Now all this has been
    brought about by the influence of the gulf stream: when the gulf stream
    took this course the glacial period ceased in Norway. That epoch none
    can tell. It will be sufficient to notice the result, which is this:
    when the polar current from Spitzbergen runs down the west coast of
    the Atlantic, and produces the great fogs off Newfoundland, the gulf
    stream, driven up from the Gulf of Florida by the force of the great
    caldron of the equator, strikes on to our west coast and the coast
    of Norway, running up to the North Cape; in fact, the only timber
    to be obtained there is the drift wood from the West Indies; and at
    Hammerfest casks of palm oil have been washed up from Cape Lopez Point,
    in Africa. In Iceland, too, as Professor Ericker Magnussen informs us,
    the bridges are made of mahogany. Not that bridges are frequent in
    that country; but those which they have are made from the logs washed
    up there. This accounts for the variety of temperature which the two
    boundaries of Norway&mdash;the gulf stream on the west, and Sweden on the
    east&mdash;present. For instance, though Bergen and Christiania are in about
    the same latitude, the average temperature at the former is 46° 8´ and
    at the latter 41° 5´; the summer average is about the same; but in the
    winter months Christiania is often 13° colder than Bergen. Hence there
    may be skating at Christiania while there is none at all at Bergen,
    where the average annual rainfall is 72 inches, which, by the way, is
    lower than that in our English lakes.</p>

  <p>The mean temperature at North Cape is 32°, the greatest cold arising
    from north-east winds. Thunder-storms occur in winter, while west winds
    cause dense fogs.</p>

  <p>At the conclusion of Forbes’s “Norway” will be found a most interesting
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>map, with isothermal lines passing through those places which have
    the same temperature in the months of January and July; and it is very
    striking to notice that the July temperature of the north of Ireland
    and Edinburgh is maintained through Norway as far as the Arctic Circle,
    when <span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>it begins to deflect to the eastward, where the gulf stream’s
    influence ceases.</p>

  <p>Again, the waterfalls are a great feature of this country. Some one
    has depicted Norway thus <img src="images/i_209a.png" class="iglyph-a" alt="" />,
    and the Alps thus <img src="images/i_209b.png" class="iglyph-b" alt="" />.
    There is much truth in this. The valleys running down to the fjords
    produce immense precipices, down which rush the many waters of the
    high plateaux of 3,000 or 4,000 feet; and in some parts these falls
    are strengthened by the waters of the vast stretch of <i>sneebræden</i>,
    or snow-fields, of which the Justedal and the Folgefond are the most
    extensive.</p>

  <p>The casual observer, looking at the map of Norway, would think it well
    populated, but a few years ago its inhabitants numbered hardly more
    than one-fourth those of London and its suburbs.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
    The names on the
    map frequently represent mere stations, farms, <i>præstegaarden</i>, or
    rectories, and villages are seldom seen. As in Scotland, the farmer
    takes the name of his land. In fact, Norway and Scotland are very
    closely allied to each other in many respects.</p>

  <p>From the Runic downwards, the wood-carving of Norway stands alone for
    distinctive characteristics, and is still carried on in every variety
    by means of the simple national tolle-knife, which is ready for
    everything.</p>

  <p>The lintels and carvings of the <i>staburs</i>, or store-houses, in
    Thelemarken have been already shown, but the most interesting specimens
    are found in churches, where the tortuous lines are full of originality
    and power of design. Serpents are ever-present and ever-varying,
    the museums being rich in specimens of this ecclesiastical class of
    work. Wood, and birch especially, is used for every kind of domestic
    utensil, and ornamentation is very generally introduced. Some of the
    old horse collars are beautiful, and are sometimes painted; tankards
    are richly carved; spoons profusely so; and on some occasions the
    bridegroom, if he be very expert, prepares a double spoon for the bride
    and himself, wherewith to eat their porridge simultaneously. Drinking
    bowls, salt-boxes, <i>mangel stoks</i>, are all carved; and this art is much
    encouraged by the long winter evenings.</p>

  <p>The old silver of Norway is so large a subject that a series of
    illustrations <span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>would be necessary to do justice to the matter; but
    its day is fast passing away. The peasants and fishermen have found
    new outlets for their earnings, and the time has gone by when they
    wondered what new thing they could have made in the precious metal;
    in fact, electro-plate is now invading Gamle Norge. May the <i>bönder</i>
    select the blessings of civilisation and eschew its evils! May their
    home happiness and love be ever-increasing, and the kind welcome which
    we have so often experienced never decrease in heartiness! For a time
    farewell!</p>
